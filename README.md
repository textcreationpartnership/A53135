THE Countermine: Or, A ſhort but true DISCOVERY OF THE Dangerous Principles, and ſecret Practices of
1. THE CONTENTS.

#####Body#####

1. THE COƲNTERMINE; Or, a ſhort but true DISCOVERY, &c.

    _ CHAP. I. The Reaſons and Occaſion of the following Diſcourſe. The imminent danger of the Church and State, by reaſon of the reſtleſs Endeavours, induſtrious Malice, and ſecret Contrivances of diſſenting Separatiſts.

    _ CHAP. II. Of the Policy of the Enemies of the Church and State, to amuſe us with the old Stratagem of Fears and Jealouſies of the danger of Popery. Hereby they ingratiate themſelves with the Common People. The improbability that the Romiſh Perſwaſion and Government ſhould ever be eſtabliſhed again in theſe Nations: if it has of late increaſed amongſt us, we are obliged for it to Diſſenters, who have made thoſe breaches by which thoſe Enemies enter. By theſe Fears and Jealouſies, which they ſow in the minds of the People, they endeavour to make them hate the preſent Government and Governours, both in Church and State, perſwading them they are Popiſhly inclined and Antichriſtian, and thus ſecretly undermine the foundation of Monarchy and Epiſcopacy.

    _ CHAP. III. An Account of the Heads of theſe Factions amongſt us, from whence we may
conjecture what their Intentions are: Of their way of Education in the Times of the late Rebellion, in the Ʋniverſities, or in the Army. Of their Lay-Teachers, and Shop-Doctors; how they came by their Gifts and Talent in Preaching; the Advantages they made of Religion in their Trades; the Employments they had under the Ʋſurping Governments; the Incouragement they had to invade the Pulpit: The deſire they have of an alteration in the preſent Government, to recover their former Power and Profit. The great unfitneſs of theſe men to officiate in the Church, who are guilty of Sacriledg, Murder, and Perjury.

    _ CHAP. IV. Of the Ways whereby they decoy others to be of their Perſwaſion. Of the great
pretenſions they make to Zeal and Holineſs. Of the great Veneration they ſeem to have for the Scriptures, when yet they are directly againſt them. Inſtanced in two Poſitive Commands, to obey Magiſtrates in the State, and thoſe that have the Rule over them in the Church. The unreaſonableneſs of the Pleas they make for their diſobedience, which if allowed muſt take away all the Power of Superiours, and cancel all the Duty of Inferiours. The Impotency of that Plea of expecting expreſs Scripture as the only Warrant for all our Actions. The unpracticableneſs of it ſhewn in a familiar and very poſſible Inſtance.

    _ CHAP. V. Of the ſeveral Arts they uſe to gain Love, Credit, Eſteem, and Veneration. Of their pretences to Exemplary Piety in their Actions, Words, Looks, Geſtures, Habits. Of the way of their maintenance by Free-will Offerings, the Advantages they have thereby over the Clergie of the Church; it eaſes them of
a great trouble, and preſerves the love of their Auditors, who liket his Goſpel-way, where they may at their pleaſure withdraw their Bounty, it ſecures them from the Penal Laws. Of the Advantage they make of Puniſhment, by calling it Perſecution; of their ſeeming Conſtancy in ſuffering for what they call Conſcience; hereby they gain love, pity, and money: They make this Perſecution an infallible Mark of the trite Church; the uſe they make of it, to render the Government odious to the People, and to diſpoſe them by degrees to endeavour the alteration of the preſent, which they call Reformation. The ſame Arts made uſe of to promote the late Rebellion.

    _ CHAP. VI. Of their Endeavours to inſinuate themſelves into the Favour of Perſons of Quality: And that notwithſtanding their Flatteries, they are the greateſt Enemies to Gentry, Nobility, and Royal Dignity. Of the manner how they creep
into Populous Places, and the Arts they uſe to endear themſelves to the People, by putting them out of a good Opinion of their Lawful Miniſter. The Reaſon of their ſettling in Market-Towns or Populous Villages, where there is not already ſome prevailing Sect. Tradeſmen lovers of Reading, and have time to peruſe their poyſonous Writings. Hereby, they propagate their way, the Shopkeeper mingling and retailing their Doctrines amongſt his other Wares: With their deſign upon Corporations in future Elections of Parliaments.

    _ CHAP. VII. After they are ſettled in ſuch Places, of the Manner of their behaviour in the Meeting-Houſe. Of their Extempore Prayer. Examined and expoſed to open View. Of the Pretence they make to
gain Veneration, that they Pray by the Spirit. The ill uſe they employ it in, to make the ſet and appointed Formes of Publick Prayers Nauſeous and Odious to the People. Proved from Scripture and the Expreſs Command of our Saviour, that it is not of Gods appointment, nor a fruit of the Spirit. By Example of the moſt infamous and abominable Sinners guilty of Rebellion and Witchcraft, who had this faculty even to admiration. Extempore Prayer ſhewn to be a meer Art, the way how they or any Perſon indued with a tolerable meaſure of Confidence may attain to it. A probable Philoſophical Reaſon, why they fancy themſelves inſpired in theſe Enthuſiaſtick Effuſions.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Of the Doctrines they chiefly inſiſt upon, and in which they firſt inſtruct their
Hearers. And firſt of the Doctrine of abſolute and irreſpective Decrees of Election and Reprobation; Of their Way of trial of their Followers, whether they he the Elect, by knowing the punctual time of their Call, Repentance, ſorrow for ſin, &c. The agreeableneſs of this Doctrine to their Followers, whom for being ſuch, they perſwade that they are certainly the Elect; and that they cannot fall totally and finally from Grace. Their ſigns of Election proved falſe from Judas the Son of Perdition, who had all they make the infallible Marks of Election, and ſomething more, viz. Reſtitution, which they will not be be perſwaded to.

    _ CHAP. IX. Of the great danger of this Doctrine as they apply it. Firſt, to themſelves; It fills them with a groundleſs and falſe confidence of the goodneſs of their Spiritual Condition; makes it almoſt impoſſible to convince them by Reaſon or Scripture, though they live after the Fleſh, in Hatred, Envy, Malice, Diſobedience, &c. but that they have the Spirit, and live
after the Spirit, and are new Creatures. It fills them with Pride, and Phariſaical contempt of others; puts them into Security, the moſt dangerous Condition a man can be in.

    _ CHAP. X. Of the ill Conſequences this Doctrine has upon the private Communities where it comes. From hence proceeds a certain breach of Ʋnity. No People ſo addicted to Debates, Envyings, Strife, Backbitings, Whiſperings, Slanders, condemning, cenſuring all who are not of their Way to be Reprobate, as are the Separatiſts. Ʋncharitableneſs and Atheiſm hereby extremely propagated; they ſeparate the deareſt Eriends, and by creeping into Houſes, and beguiling ſilly Women, divide thoſe whom God had joined together; they are curious buſie-bodies in eſpying out the faults of all others; which they publiſh to make themſelves appear the Elect, and all others Reprobates. All this is done to fit them to act upon the publick Theatre of the World which they practiſe in private Villages, or where ever they dwell.

    _ CHAP. XI. Of the Wicked Deſign they have, by the ſtrength of this Doctrine to overthrow the preſent Church and its Government. Which, by their pretending to be the Elect who Worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, they endeavour to make unlawful and Antichriſtian. This Doctrine contrary to Gods promiſe to be with his Church to the End of the World; and derogatorie to his Honour. Of the falſe aſperſions they ſecretly caſt upon the Church, and the publique Service of God. Of the inconvenience of arguing with them; and the advantages they make thereof. Their impudence in boaſting themſelves and arguments invincible. Of their diſlike of Places of publique Worſhip; of the treatment they met with in the times of their Power, the houſe of Prayer made a Den of Theeves. Of their inveterate Hatred againſt Biſhops and the Liturgie. Of the dangerous Tenent they maintain, that all People, Princes and Magiſtrats are bound to pull down Antichriſtwhich with them is Epiſcopacy; and that if Princes will not, the People may if they can get the Power into their hands. Which makes them graſp continually at Dominion.

    _ CHAP. XII. Of the Deſperate influences this Doctrine has upon the State and Civil Government. This Amazon Fury bred in Rebellion, and ever ſince nurſt up with blood, proved from our own and all Europe's ſad Experience. This Doctrine inclines men to Ariſtocracy, or the Government of a Common-wealth. Of the little kindneſs they have for Monarchy.
Salus populi Suprema Lex, their fundamental Principle of Government; abuſed to perſwade Men. that the Peoples Election and approbation are neceſſary Titles to a Crown. That a King is Major Singulis, Minor Univerſis, and may be depoſed and puniſhed by the People, proved from their practice. The great Encouragement it gives to Rebellion, and Courage to Rebels. The ſame Doctrine of Fatality taught by Mahomet to inſpire the Turks with Courage againſt the Chriſtians.

    _ CHAP. XIII. Of their Doctrine of the neceſſity of Separation from the Wicked, which they teach in Private; and by their Example in Publick. Theſe uſes they make of it; to know their ſtrength and numbers, which they always boaſt of, if poſſible to bring Authority to comply with their Deſires: hereby they engroſs a Trade amongst themſelves. Of their undermining Authority by making it contemptible, by their daily affronting it. Of the unlawfulneſs of Separation, from the example of our Saviour, and from Scripture. Separation by St. Jude made a mark of Reprobation. Jeroboams Policy the End of their Separation.

    _ CHAP. XIV. Of their Exaltation of Preaching, and the Reaſon why they do ſo. Of the great Veneration people have for the Pulpit. The advantages they make of it, to gain the love of People for being ſo painful Labourers; diſperſing their Doctrines, and procuring Benevolences. Hereby they bring the Prayers of the Church to be nauſeous, accuſtom People to variety and novelty, and have opportunities of diſplaying their Gifts and Abilities, as well as in Extempore-Prayer. The Abuſe they put upon the Church, that it is againſt Preaching. A vindication of the Church from this aſperſion. Of the Primitive and Modern Preaching: It is againſt preaching themſelves, and their own Intereſts and wicked Deſigns that the Church declares it ſelf.

    _ CHAP. XV. A ſhort View of ſome other of their Doctrines. Of their Judaizing the Lords Day. Of their cenſuring all their Anceſtors, and even their own Children to Damnation. Their ſubtilty in denying all theſe Accuſations, and diſowning the Actions of the late Rebels, when yet
they tread in the very ſame ſteps. That they have the ſame Deſign, manifeſted from their great Induſtry in all late New Elections of Members of the preſent Parliament, to get Voices for ſuch as will be favourable to their intereſt. A probable Conjecture that they have had a principal hand in the late unhappy Differences betwixt the Two Houſes; and of the great Deſire they have of a New Parliament; and their hopes when that ſhall happen.

    _ CHAP. XVI. Of the Artifices which theſe men uſe to render all applications ineffectual; by their tiring out the Inferiour Magiſtracy with their Obſtinacy. The advantage they make of the ſuſpenſion of Laws to fortifie their followers, and perſwading them it is a particular effect of the care which God takes of them and the Cauſe. That place in the Acts, of Gamaliel''s Counſel, If
this Work be of God it will ſtand, by which they frighten ſome, and endeavour to diſcourage all people from meddling with them conſidered, and proved to be the Word of Gamaliel a Doctor of the Law, but not the Word of God, becauſe not univerſally true.

    _ CHAP. XVII. A more particular Survey of their Policy in rendring all Expedients uſeleſs which have been applied to reclaim them, from that place in Ezra 7.16. Of Capital Puniſhments. Of Impriſonment, how they make of advantage to them, to confirm their Cauſe and Followers, and to bring a general Odium upon the Laws and Government: their evaſions to eſcape Forfeitures. Of their complaints of the injuſtice and oppreſſion of the Penal Laws. Of Baniſhment: A Coffee-houſe Dialogue about it, betwixt Mr. Kinglove of — and a Grand-child of Martin Mar-Prelates.

    _ CHAP. XVIII. The Heads of Separation brought to tryal by the Scripture, proved to be falſe Prophets by their Fruits, by the Deſcription of them, by the Time of their appearance; the Signs given to know them by. Wolves in Sheeps Clothing. Their pretence to be the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs. The way they would evade theſe Signs; their Plea of not guilty, becauſe not guilty of all, manifeſted to be vain; and ſuch as, if admitted, will clear all, even Mahomet, from the guilt of being falſe Prophet.

    _ CHAP. XIX. A further purſuance of the diſcovery, and that theſe Men are Falſe Prophets from the Deſcription of St. Paul and St. Peter St. Peter's 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, and St. Judes〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, conſidered as particularly deſigned to ſhew their Infectious Contagious Doctrines. Of their deſpiſing Dominions, querulous, unſatiſfied and complaining Humour. A ſhort vindication of the Church from their malicious Aſperſion of being Guilty of Idolatry.

    _ CHAP. XX. THE CONCLƲSION.
