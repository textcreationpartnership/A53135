            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <label>CHAP. II.</label> Of the Policy of the Enemies of the Church and State, to amuſe us with the old Stratagem of Fears and Jealouſies of the Danger of Popery. Hereby they ingratiate themſelves with the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The improbability that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Government ſhould ever be eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in theſe Nations. If it has of late increaſed amongſt us, we are obliged for it to theſe Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who have made thoſe Breaches by which theſe Enemies enter. By theſe Fears and Jealouſies which they ſow in the Minds of People, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make them hate the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Governours, both in Church and State;
<pb facs="tcp:101567:3"/>perſwading them they are Popiſhly inclined, and Antichriſtian: And thus ſecretly undermine the Foundation of Monarchy and Epiſcopacy.</item>

III.</label> An Account of the Heads of the Factions amongſt us, from whence we may conjecture what their Intentions are: Of their way of Education in the Times of the late Rebellion, in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, or in the Army. Of their Lay-Teachers, and Shop-Doctors; how they came by their Gifts and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in Preaching; the Advantages they made of Religion in their Trades, the Employments they had under the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurping Governments, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement they had to invade the Pulpit: The deſire they have of an alteration in the preſent Government, to recover their former Power and Profit.

                  <label>CHAP. IV.</label> Of the Ways whereby they decoy others to be of their Perſwaſion. Of the great pretentions they make to Zeal and Holineſs. Of the great Veneration they ſeem to have for the Scriptures; when yet they are directly againſt them. Inſtanced in two Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commands, to obey Magiſtrates in the State,
<pb facs="tcp:101567:3"/>and thoſe that have the Rule over them in the Church. The unreaſonableneſs of the Pleas they make for their diſobedience, which if allowed muſt take away all the Power of Superiours, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all the Duty of Inferiours. The Impotency of that Plea of expecting expreſs Scripture as the only Warrant for all our Actions. The unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cableneſs of it ſhewn in a familiar and very poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inſtance.</item>

Of the manner how they creep into Popular Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Arts they uſe to endear themſelves to the People, by putting them out of a good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their Lawful Miniſter. The Reaſon of their ſetling in Market-Towns, or Populous Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, where there is not already ſome prevailing Sect.

Proved from Scripture and the Expreſs Commands of our Saviour, that it is not of Gods appointment, nor a fruit of the Spirit. By Example of the moſt infamous and abominable Sinners guilty of Rebellion and Witchcraft, who had this faculty even to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer ſhewn to be a meer Art, the way how they or any Perſon indued with a tolerable meaſure of Confidence may attain to it. A probable Philoſophical Reaſon, why they fancy themſelves inſpired in theſe Enthuſiaſtick Effuſions.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. VIII.</label> Of the Doctrines they chiefly inſiſt upon, and in which they firſt inſtruct their Hearers. And firſt of the Doctrine of abſolute and irreſpective De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Election and Reprobation; Of their Way of trial of their Followers, whether they be the Elect, by knowing the punctual time of their Call, Repentance, ſorrow for ſin, &amp;c. The agreeableneſs of this Doctrine to their Followers, whom for being ſuch, they perſwade that they are certainly the Elect; and that they cannot fall totally and finally from Grace. Their ſigns of Election proved falſe from <hi>Judas</hi> the Son of
<pb facs="tcp:101567:5"/>Perdition, who had all they make the infallible Marks of Election, and ſomething more, <hi>viz.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which they will not be perſwaded to.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. IX.</label> Of the great danger of this Doctrine, as they apply it. Firſt to themſelves, it fills them with a groundleſs and falſe confidence of the goodneſs of their Spiritual Condition: makes it almoſt impoſſible to convince them by Reaſon or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though they live after the Fleſh, in Hatred, Envy, Malice, Diſobedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that they have the Spirit, and live after the Spirit, and are new Creatures. It fills them with Pride, and Phariſaical contempt of others; puts them into Security, the moſt dangerous Condition a man can be in.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. X.</label> Of the ill Conſequences this Doctrine has upon the private Communities where it comes. From hence proceeds a certain breach of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity. No people ſo addicted to Debates, Envyings, Strife, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings, Whiſperings, Slanders, condemning, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring all who are not of their Way, to be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, as theſe Separatiſts. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs and Atheiſm hereby extreamly propagated: they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the deareſt Friends; and by creeping into
<pb facs="tcp:101567:5"/>Houſes, and beguiling ſilly Women, divide thoſe whom God hath joined together; they are curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and buſie-bodies in eſpying out the faults of all others; which they publiſh to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves appear the Elect, and all others Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates. All this is done to fit them to act upon the publick Theater of the World, which they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in private Villages, or where ever they dwell.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. XI.</label> Of the wicked Deſign they have by the ſtrength of this Doctrine, to overthrow the preſent Church and its Government; which by their pretending to be the Elect, who worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, they endeavour to make <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful and Antichriſtian. This Doctrine contrary to Gods Promiſe to be with his Church to the end of the World, and derogatory to his Honour. Of the falſe aſperſions they ſecretly caſt upon the Church and the Publick Service of God. Of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of arguing with them, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages they make thereof; their Impudence in boaſting Themſelves and Arguments invincible. Of their Diſlike of Places of Publick Worſhip. Of the treatment they met with in the time of their Power. The Houſe of Prayer made a Den of Thieves. Of their inveterate Hatred againſt Biſhops and the Liturgie. Of the dangerous Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb facs="tcp:101567:6"/>they maintain, That all People, Princes and Magiſtrates, are bound to pull down Antichriſt, which with them is Epiſcopacy; and that if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will not, the People may, if they can get Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into their hands; which makes them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally graſp at Dominion.</item>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. XII.</label> Of the deſperate Influences this Doctrine has upon the State and Civil Government. This Amazon Fury bred in Rebellion, and ever ſince nurſt up with Blood; proved from our own and all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>'s ſad Experience: This Doctrine inclines men to <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> or the Government of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. Of the little kindneſs they have for Monarchy. <hi>Salus Populi ſuprema Lex,</hi> their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principle of Government, abuſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men that the Peoples Election and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation are neceſſary Titles to a Crown.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE never was any Age in which the Holy Church of God was more truly Militant, than in the preſent. The envious Dragon,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.12, 13.</note> knowing that he hath but a ſhort time, has ſummoned up all his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101567:9"/>Infernal Militia, to make one great and vigorous attempt upon the perſecuted Woman: having forcibly driven her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderneſs, he throws out of his mouth water as a flood, that if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, he may cauſe her to be carried away by thoſe Deluges and Inundations of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
               <p>IN a danger ſo eminent, every good Soldier of Chriſt Jeſus is bound by the <hi>Sacramentum Militare</hi> of his Baptiſm, to do the utmoſt of his endeavours, and earneſtly to contend for the Faith,<note place="margin">Jude <hi>v.</hi> 3.</note> which was once delivered to the Saints: and not only be contented to ſtand faſt in that Faith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.13.</note> but to quit himſelf like a man and be ſtrong.</p>
               <p>THAT Son muſt needs have little Courage, and leſs Duty, who can ſee a moſt beautiful, tender, and indulgent Mother, proſtituted to the barbarous rage of her moſt implacable Enemies, and the murdering Steel ready to be plunged into her innocent Boſom; and all that while ſtand gazing on; or ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that time in childiſh and fruitleſs Laments, which he ought to employ to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her preſent reſcue and ſpeedy aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101567:9"/>I am not ignorant, that whoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns himſelf with the preſent Enemies of the Church, puts his hand into a Neſt of Hornets; and had need to be well guarded both with Law and Innocence, if he hopes to ſcape their ſtings; and poſſibly that Conſideration, together with the natural inclination of my Genius above all other things to quiet and repoſe, might have been powerful enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert me from this deſign, if ſome ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reaſons had not put me upon it.</p>
               <p>BUT leſt by ſome in this ſcribling Age I might be thought infected with the common Malady, <hi>Scribendi Cacoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes:</hi> I do here enter my ſolemn Proteſt againſt it; and that I had no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in making my thoughts publick, but to ſatisfie the importunities of my own mind, by diſcharging that Duty I owe to God and the Holy Church: And if I cannot prevent the common, and by conſequence my particular danger, I ſhall yet have the ſatisfaction that I have not by my ſilence conſented to it; nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that, it may be, even beyond my Province, I have attempted to do it.</p>
               <p>THE goodneſs of actions is not to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101567:10"/>be meaſured by their proſperous ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and if that fails to anſwer the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of my wiſhes and deſires, I ſhall yet have avoided the imputation of their folly, of whom the Hiſtorian tells us, who were known <hi>ſilendo periiſſe,</hi> to have periſht by either their imprudent or wilful ſilence.</p>
               <p>THE knowledg I have of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion there is betwixt the Deſign and the Undertaker, might alſo it may be diſcourage me from the Enterprize, if I did not remember, that once a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptlble Sling and ordinary Pebble, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the prodigious man of <hi>Gath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.49, 50, 51.</note> and overthrew an Army, not leſs numerous or inſolent than this with which I am to encounter.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell, whether ſome mens prevailing Fears, and the deſire of that ſecurity which they vainly hope to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, by what they call tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and moderation; or the over tender Charity of others towards their<note n="(a)" place="margin">Who yet ſcorn that Epithete farther than it ſerves their intereſt, and are Giants in their own opinion, though in other mens, and in truth, more wilful than weak.</note> weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, have hindred them from ſpeaking plain: But I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that moſt of thoſe Prints which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101567:10"/>have of late days paſt the Preſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, have been handled with as much niceneſs and caution, as men with naked hands would treat the peeviſh Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, or armed Brambles.</p>
               <p>MUCH has been ſaid, written, and printed in Vindication of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> her Rites and Ceremonies. But I find that theſe Apologies have always been rendred ſuſpected of partiality, and ſo made uſeleſs by the Heads of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration amongſt their credulous Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and being uſually Books of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Price than every mans Pocket could eaſily reach; and of a larger content than either that or their capacity could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble contain; the ordinary ſort of people being willing to ſpare both the expence of their Money and Time, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to a clear underſtanding of the Controverſies, but determine their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the opinions and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of their Heads, to whom they have wholly reſigned themſelves and their Faith. Now it is moſt undoubted, that the Character which they will give of all ſuch Writings, is never free from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, or ever favourable to any thing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101567:11"/>that is againſt their own Practice or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
               <p>AND if at any time ſome of the more curious or inquiſitive, ſtartled with the common Vogue, demand of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rabbi, what is his ſenſe of the Learned and Judicious Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> the pious Mr. <hi>Comber,</hi> or the late incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable both learned and moſteſt Mr. <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi> or of any other Pieces of that kind, ſo highly cryed up by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>-men? he will not fail to do all he can to perſwade them not to loſe ſo much time in reading ſuch frothy ſtuff, which is nothing but untemper'd Mortar, to dawb over the Temple of Antichriſt, which notwithſtanding all that can be done to ſupport it, muſt down, muſt fall very ſuddenly; and that they may much better ſpend their precious time, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the godly Works of ſuch or ſuch a man, of his own Opinion, with which Seditious Sermons the world is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably peſtered. But that he may ſay ſomething in anſwer to their Queſtion; <hi>Hooker</hi> (of whom one may by his actions probably conjecture he never read more than the Title Page) he will tell them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101567:11"/>writ againſt ſome factious ſpirits in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days; but that concerns not them. And for the reſt they will not want ſomething to ſay againſt them; which though it cannot enervate their maſculine Arguments, yet ſhall infallibly prejudice and ſully either their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or intention in writing. The <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Debate</hi> is an extravagant Droll, <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Eccleſiaſtica</hi> was penn'd in hopes of Preferment, the <hi>Companion to the Altar</hi> is no Companion fit for them, the <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale</hi> upon the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> has no more Reaſon than what it wears upon the Frontiſpiece. And though I do pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely conceal both my Name and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and will not tell them whether I am a Lay-man or an Eccleſiaſtick, nor ſhall all their induſtry find it out, if I can prevent it; yet I do expect the ſame or worſe treatment and meaſure from them, and to hear their Random-ſhot whiſtle about my Ears.</p>
               <p>LET them ſay or think who I am, or what they pleaſe of me; and were that all the Liberty of Conſcience they would deſire or demand, they ſhould not fail of a willing and ſpeedy gratification:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101567:12"/>and I cannot therefore be thought unjuſt, if I expect the ſame liberty which I would grant to others. My intentions are to deal plainly with them, and to proceed without favour or affection, ſo far as I have the Warranty of Truth, and no further, to the beſt of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: Neither will I be tedious, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch what I have to ſay in as few words as is poſſible; and as near as I can I will calculate it for the Meridian of all Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, ſo as neither to endanger the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Brains, nor if poſſible to diſpleaſe the ſtrongeſt: And herein I ſhall act like a Phyſician, of which Profeſſion (or an Apothecary) they may gueſs me if they pleaſe; and ſince the Doſe I am prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is like to be very ſtrong, I will give it in the leſſer quantity. I know it will work briskly, and be apt <hi>movere Bilem;</hi> make ſome perſons vomit abundance of Choler: and it may be that which is blackeſt upon their Stomachs: in others it will ſtrongly ſtir the Splene, not ſo much to Laughter as Revenge. If it does but in any meaſure contribute to the purging out that Epidemick Scurvy in the Body Politick, which betrays it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101567:12"/>ſelf by thoſe dangerous ſymptomes, of foul Mouths, ſtinking Breaths, and the looſneſs of the Tongue more than the Teeth, in many perſons; I ſhall be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied: And if I may but ſee any good Effects, I am ſo little ſollicitous for any private or particular advantage, more than my ſhare in the Publick Good, that I care not whether the Cauſe be ever known.</p>
               <p>THERE is no Science ſo true as the Mathematicks, one of its infallible Demonſtrations is, <hi>Maximum poſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veri a minimo:</hi> and upon that Baſis I will lay the foundation of my hopes; and how contemptible ſoever the firſt Mover may appear, I will not deſpair, but that this little Wheel may give a Motion to thoſe which are far greater, and more powerful. A ſingle hair if rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, may ſet that Engine at work, which will want nothing beſides <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> his convenient place to fix it upon, to remove the Terreſtrial Globe from off its Centre.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Policy of the Enemies of the Church and State, to amuſe us with the old Stratagem of Fears and Jealouſies of the danger of Popery. Hereby they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate themſelves with the Common People. The improbability that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſwaſion and Government ſhould ever be eſtabliſhed again in theſe Nations: if it has of late increaſed amongſt us, we are obliged for it to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, who have made thoſe breaches by which thoſe Enemies enter. By theſe Fears and Jealouſies, which they ſow in the minds of the People, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make them hate the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Governours, both in Church and State, perſwading them they are Popiſhly inclined and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, and thus ſecretly undermine the foundation of Monarchy and Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy.</head>
               <p>IT is no uncommon Stratagem in War, to make falſe Aſſaults againſt a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged Place, thereby to call away the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101567:13"/>perplexed Defendants from that place where the Storm is intended in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. It were well if this were not our caſe: and truly the preſent face and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of our Affairs does not look much unlike it; for though there ſeems to be the greateſt diſtance betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> yet herein they both agree, that they are our common Enemies: and whilſt the bolder <hi>Roman</hi> openly threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens us with an Aſſault, the crafty <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian,</hi> with his Confederate Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, are buſie at the Mine; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is not my ſingle Opinion, That more places, otherways impregnable, have ſubmitted to the Will of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour by that Artifice, than by the open fury of the Cannon. And ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is the practice of that invention in a Politick ſenſe, that how contemptible ſoever an Enemy may appear, if in that Deſign they make an undiſcovered pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, there will never want ſome deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Faux</hi>'s to ſpring their Mines; which if they ſucceed, will blow up all from the very Foundations, and bury the beſt built Government in the World in its own Aſhes and Ruines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101567:14"/>I have read of a City whoſe Walls were overthrown, without any other Enemies or Engines, than the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Moles. Whether true or fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, it matters not: ſure I am if it be meerly a Fable, the Moral may not be unuſeful to us; and though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon may be odious, yet it is but too agreeable to a ſort of men, whoſe reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and miſchievous Tempers and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions hurry them blindly on, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of their ill Deſigns, by ſecret and underhand Practices, ſo long as they are out of hopes to effect them by open Force and Violence.</p>
               <p>BUT they muſt know they are not ſo ſecret or ſecure as they imagine; and there are a great many amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who contribute not a little to our aſſiſtance in Countermining of them: And if I might adviſe them, they ſhould not only be extreamly cautelous how they intruſt one another with the <hi>GRAND DESIGN</hi> and <hi>SECRET,</hi> but even how they truſt themſelves: for Treachery and Baſeneſs are ſo natural to them, that they cannot forbear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying themſelves; and let them <hi>Swear</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101567:14"/>or <hi>Forſwear, Proteſt</hi> and <hi>Verily</hi> as often as they pleaſe, yet at one time or another their ſpeeches will diſcover them to be <hi>Galileans:</hi> and I fear, juſt ſuch as he was before he obeyed the ſummons of the Cock, to go out and weep bitterly,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Mat. 26.75.</note> which they have likewiſe need to do.</p>
               <p>ONE of the greateſt Arts, by which they ſecure themſelves, whilſt they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe us, is to perſwade the world of a ſtrange growth and encreaſe of Popery amongſt us; and that they are the only perſons who ſtand in the Breach; and by their Long Prayers, by their ſound and Evangelical Doctrine, give a check to that threatning Deluge and Inundation. This does extremely ingratiate them with the Common People, to whom the Name of <hi>Popery</hi> is far more terrible than that of <hi>Mahumetaniſm:</hi> and to make theſe Fears and Jealouſies appear ſomething more probable, and not only conjectural, they do not ſcruple the lowdeſt Calumnies, and plainly enough to intimate, that all things are in the greateſt forwardneſs to entertain this dreadful Revolution. All the eminent Prelates and Doctors of the Church, being as they affirm, favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101567:15"/>inclined to that Faith; and ſome of them already ſuſpected to be ſecretly of that Perſwaſion. All our Prayers, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, Altars, Bowings, Veſtments, and the other Decencies of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, are already Popiſh and Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: and hereby they do not only eſtabliſh theſe Fears and Jealouſies,<note place="margin">Hinc ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere voces In vulgum ambiguas; &amp; quaerere conſcius arma.</note> the Prologues to greater Miſchiefs; but render all the Publick Service of God ſuſpected, if not odious amongſt the Populace.</p>
               <p>AND I doubt not, but if a late Act of Parliament againſt Treaſonable Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ſome little Love they have for their Lives and Eſtates, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Inſolence, they would fix their Calumnies and Slanders upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the higheſt Character in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And it is neither Duty nor Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance nor Modeſty, but fear and ſelf-love which does prohibit them from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo high.</p>
               <p>NOW to my apprehenſion there is nothing does more plainly manifeſt the Vanity of theſe Fears and Jealouſies (and that they have another Deſign in diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them abroad) than the uſe which they conſtantly employ them in. And that is this:</p>
               <p>

Nor will the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion ever recover any tolerable credit, ſo long as the Cruelties of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſion in Eighty Eight, and thoſe threatned Inhumanities, the Powder-Treaſon, the Inquiſition, or the late horrid Rebellion and Maſſacre in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which influenced that in <hi>England,</hi> are either remembred or feared. All which makes it ſtrongly improbable, That any Prince or Government, either in Church or State, (who muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity conſult their own intereſt in the quiet and welfare of their People) ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to introduce that Religion, to which the People their Subjects, of all Degrees and Conditions, diſcover ſuch a general averſion, and univerſal deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and which therefore muſt create infinite troubles and moſt deſperate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:101567:16"/>AND if it be well conſidered, we ſhall find that the Jeſuites, and all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Factors have not been able for this laſt Century,<note place="margin">Some perſons are ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken, if the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium de propaganda fide</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> has not been very helpful in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe Diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; for they know well enough what that means, <hi>Divide &amp; Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> which employment theſe Diſſenters take out of their hands, as being the greater Artiſts in this Myſtery of Iniquity.</note> ſo effectually to ſerve the intereſt of their own Affairs, as theſe Perſons have done; and if the Papiſts have made many or conſiderable Proſelytes, poſſibly they owe them to thoſe Diviſions which theſe men have made in our Church, and not to any ſtrength of Arguments they are able to produce, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of any Errouts either in our Doctrine or Diſcipline. And though he muſt be a great Stranger in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Tranſactions, who is ignorant how great Diſſentions, Heats, and Animoſities are amongſt the Religious of their ſeveral Orders; and how great differences even about their main Queſtion of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, there are amongſt their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; nay how great Diſſentions have been amongſt the Popes themſelves, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their pretended Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: yet the great Motive they make uſe of to induce any perſon to return to the

               <p>BUT as I believe the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or any other Diſſenter, has no real Deſign or Intention to oblige the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though there is no doubt to be made, but that by their Diviſions they do extremely advance the <hi>Roman</hi> Intereſt and Affairs; ſo I am ſatisfied that their aim is only to amuſe us, and pleaſe the People, till ſuch time as they have made their Party ſtrong enough againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of which they are in reality more afraid, than they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Pope or <hi>Turk,</hi> and could they but once come to be uppermoſt, and have the power of the Sword, they would be ſo far from being afraid of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s double Dagger, that if the Pope did not civilly leave them to the management of their own Affairs, they would hazard to make the triple Diadem ſhake; and I know they have ſtrong hopes to deſtroy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101567:17"/>the Kingdom of Antichriſt, which when they had finiſhed at home, they might have a temptation, having an eaſier paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the <hi>Streights,</hi> than <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> had over the <hi>Alps,</hi> to invade <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony, and burn the great Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> with fire, and fulfil all the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> without the aſſiſtance of Kings, though there 'tis ſaid that they ſhall do it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> An Account of the Heads of theſe Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt us, from whence we may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101567:17"/>conjecture what their Intentions are: Of their way of Education in the Times of the late Rebellion, in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, or in the Army. Of their Lay-Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Shop-Doctors; how they came by their Gifts and Talent in Preaching; the Advantages they made of Religion in their Trades; the Employments they had under the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurping Governments; the Incouragement they had to invade the Pulpit: The deſire they have of an alteration in the preſent Government, to recover their former Power and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. The great unfitneſs of theſe men to officiate in the Church, who are guilty of Sacriledg, Murder, and Perjury.</head>
               <p>LET us come therefore to take a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of their Perſons: from thence we will proceed to their Principles; which will quickly lead us to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Practices.</p>
               <p>AS to their Perſons, we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them as that pleaſant fellow divided the World, into two parts, one of which was born to cheat the other; or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the more cuſtomary and familiar method; we muſt divide them into the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101567:18"/>Heads and Body: for by the Way I muſt tell you, that theſe Factions have one remarkable Qualification of a Monſter, that to one Body there are many Heads; all challenging Equality, though at the ſame time every one of them aimes at Priority. The Body being for the moſt compoſed of thoſe who are deceived, I ſhall not concern my ſelf with them, as the Principal Subjects of this Diſcourſe: for if at any time, one of this Body ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances ſo far as to be able to deceive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that Member preſently ſtarts up to be a Head. 'Tis theſe Heads and their Hands that we have juſt reaſon to ſuſpect and to be afraid of, and with theſe therefore I chiefly intend to deal.</p>
               <p>THESE Heads muſt likewiſe be ſubdivided (which is natural to them) into two Claſſes; which Word will pleaſe ſome of them, though it may be the diſtinction will not: They are either <hi>Scholaſticks,</hi> or <hi>Laicks,</hi> Literate, or Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Heads. The <hi>Scholaſticks</hi> are ſuch as either had their Education in one of the Univerſities, or in the Army-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, during the late precious times, when the Saints bore the ſway, and rul'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101567:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>theſe Nations with a Rod of Iron, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sword: and with that Iron-Scepter broke their Enemies in pieces like a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Veſſel.</p>
               <p>IF they are ſuch as ſuckt the Breaſts of either of the Univerſities, 'tis odds but they are ſome of thoſe who were nurſt up immediately after their poor Mothers had moſt outragiouſly been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; when little nouriſhment was to be drawn from them, that was not mixt with Blood; or however with ſome of that Phyſick which the Mountebanks of the Age gave them, to recover that Health which they had firſt taken from them: and it is well enough known that the Vertue of the Medicine will paſs through the Mother to the Child. This <q>Phyſick was their <hi>Pan-pharmacon,</hi> called the Solemn League and Covenant. Which was afterwards corrected with a Pill, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Engagement</hi> to be true to the Government, without a King or Houſe of Peers:</q> and the Dregs or theſe poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous and ill-prepared Medicines, ſtick as cloſe to theſe men as their very Natures: ſo that without the danger of being thought a Conjurer, it is eaſie to gueſs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101567:19"/>what they are, and what they would be at? I'le lay my life on't they love the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the dear Good old Cauſe, a great deal better than a Prince or a Prelate; without which they have ſworn to live; and whoſe utter Extirpation (with<note n="*" place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Covenant, by which it appears they are not againſt all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> hands lift up to Heaven) they have ſo ſolemnly ſworn and vowed: and their Conſciences are ſo infinitely tender, that they would not break their Oaths, to gain the whole World (no more than <hi>Herod</hi> would do his) though never ſo impious and unlawful. And yet theſe very Men ſome them, both Clergie and Laicks, made no difficulty in taking thoſe deteſtable Oaths, to cancel all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Oaths of Allegiance, Supremacy, and Canonical Obedience, which they had ſo often, as they made their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors believe, <hi>ex animo</hi> taken and ſworn.</p>
               <p>THEIR Brethren of the Armies E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, are indeed their ſworn Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi:</hi> it may be not altogether ſo well verſt in Practical, but Knockers in Polemical Divinity; they can pray two hours upon the Drum's head, make as loud a noiſe as that when 'tis higheſt brac't; and it may be are as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101567:19"/>empty too. Theſe men can fire a Piſtol in the Face of a Prince: can exerciſe a Troop, both in Martial Diſcipline and Rebellion: Theſe are ſpiritual Drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and can ſerve either as Horſe or Foot. Theſe were ſuch, who for their Eminent Gifts and Services, were divers of them poſſeſſed of the fair <hi>Demeſnes</hi> of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Clergie, and at his Majeſties late happy Reſtauration were forced to quit both their Military Dioceſes and good Livings: and no wonder then if ſome of them out of neceſſity, and for a Lively-hood; others out of Revenge, do now perſecute thoſe Perſons and that Way with their utmoſt Hatred, againſt which they once fought, or at leaſt incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged others to fight, ſo heartily and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully. And theſe are their <hi>Anteſignani</hi> of the firſt Rate, or rather <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The Sons of Thunder.</p>
               <p>AND leſt this precious Generation of men ſhould periſh, (for they are not Immortal) the breeding of the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being corrupted with Surplices and Subſcriptions; ſome perſons are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet as to commit a Son or Nephew to their Tuition; or they pick up ſome
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101567:20"/>hopeful young man (as they call him) whom they educate in their Doctrines and Diſcipline: and thus take care that the ſucceſſion may be ſecured and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>
               <p>AFTER theſe come the <hi>Laicks,</hi> Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate or Ignorant Heads; ſuch as are meerly Mechanicks: Of theſe ſome are ſuch as were in actual Armes againſt their late lawful Soveraign; and having run away from the more painful and honeſt Trades in which their Parents or Maſters gave them Education, in the Rebel Armie learnt the better Trades of War and Saintſhip, which at that time were inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably linkt together. Others of them are ſuch whoſe courage it may be was not ſo great, as to endure the ſight of a naked Sword, the claſhing of Armour, the noiſe of the Cannon, or the other Terrors of Warr: but having the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Employs of Sequeſtrators, Decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or Country Committee-men, or ſome dependance on them, ſtaid zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly at home to pray for thoſe who were couragiouſly fighting the Lords Battels againſt the Mighty abroad: and by their Rapine and Oppreſſion, making
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101567:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>long Prayers and devouring thoſe Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows Houſes, whom their Companions murdering Swords had made ſuch, in the firſt place to make Proviſion for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in the next for their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, who were to bear the Heat and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Day.</p>
               <p>Theſe Fellows were great frequenters of Sermons, thoſe things then call'd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; which indeed were very violent, and made ſuch as uſed them ſweat, whilſt they ſet their Lungs to ſale, from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit to encourage Sedition and juſtifie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: To theſe Meetings, if they could write and read, to make their Zeal the more obſervable, they never went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the neceſſary Utenſils of Pen, Ink, and a large Pocket writing-Book, which was then the high Mode of the Religious and Godly. With ſuch ſcraps of holy Non-ſenſe as they there pickt up, they charitably feaſted the Neighbourhood; and after many vain Repetitions of ſuch fragments of their Collections to their own Families, and whoever elſe would come to hear them, perſwaded of their ſtrange Gifts and Abilities, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the frequent flatteries and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101567:21"/>of others, whoſe judgment was of the ſame Standard with their own, they came at laſt to ſet up for themſelves, and in a little time to deſpiſe their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p>NOW and then you ſhould have a Cobler venture beyond his Laſt, a Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler finding out new Lights, a Grocer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing Religion, a Black-Smith with a hot ſpark of Zeal in his throat hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Hobnails and Hereſie, or a prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Apothecary prating according to the Proverb. This Crew of Shop-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, animated by the prevailing licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of the Times, their Ignorance and Impudence, with the help of ſome ſeditious Books, and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible, (which for want of underſtanding the Original they wreſt, as all unlearned and unſtable men do the Scriptures, to their own ſenſne, fanſie, and damnation) launch forth boldly into the depths of Divinity, to become Fiſhers for Men and Money: and with as much confidence as if they had the ſame Commiſſion from our great Lord and Maſter,<note place="margin">Luk. 5.6. Act. 2.41.</note> which his Diſciples had to take the miraculous draught of Fiſhes or of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:101567:21"/>NOR were the Advantages and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns which they made in this Spiritual Traffick, ſo mean or inconſiderable, but that ſtill they did encourage new Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers in the Trade; and alſo paid the firſt bold Undertakers ſufficiently for their pains. Such a man was then accounted a Confiding Man; that is, he was fit for the uſe of the State, in the neceſſary and pious Employments of Rapine, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and premeditated Murder; and hereby (which one would think very ſtrange) they got the Reputation of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and conſcientious men, juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in their Dealings, which was no ſmall ſtep to many Cuſtomers, and by light Gains and quick Returns to make a heavy Purſe for themſelves; though I doubt not but they made many heavy Hearts and light Purſes for other men; <hi>viz.</hi> the truly Loyal Subjects, who for no other Crime were called Delinquents and Malignants, and were accordingly treated in their Perſons and Eſtates, as the moſt notorious Malefactors, by theſe honeſt godly men: who for theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable Cruelties and ill-gotten riches, came to be feared by all, reſpected by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101567:22"/>many, though lov'd by few. And it was no uncuſtomary thing, to ſee one of theſe pragmatical Peaſants with his high ſhoes and Hobnails, in greater Authority than the Right Worſhipful, or it may be the Right Honourable of his Pariſh. So great gain was the Godlineſs of thoſe times, that it is no Miracle if they long and breath ſo much to ſee thoſe Goſpel-Days again.</p>
               <p>BUT leſt I ſhould be thought a little unkind in giving them the diſtinguiſhing Character of ignorant Heads; though I could produce many Inſtances, one or two ſhall ſuffice to make it appear that I am not injurious, but civil to them, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing ſo many of their follies as I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to publiſh.</p>
               <p>ONE of theſe proud and inſolent Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus's being urged to pay ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Superiors, from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who complemented the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour with that reſpectful Addreſs of moſt Noble <hi>Feſtus;</hi> found out this cunning Evaſion for his unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly Religion, that for ought he knew Moſt Noble was the Deputies Chriſtian Name.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER of the ſame form, was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101567:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſo childiſhly ignorant, even in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sentiments of Nature, as to put the Queſtion whether it was the ſame Moon, at the place where he dwelt, as was in other places? and to admire her kindneſs for travelling with him all one Evening; going if he went, and ſtanding ſtill if he did ſo, to wait upon this younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Endymion.</hi> Nay ſo ſtrangely ſilly was this Animal, as by a pleaſant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Gentleman, (who did it with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of perſonated gravity and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Artifice) to be perſwaded out of his Chriſtian Name: and yet this Fopp would ſwagger about Predeſtination and Election as boldly as the talleſt Doctor of the Tribe. And though I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a great many of them may have far more natural cunning; not many of them have much more Learning: Since I know it is not now to be hoped for by a Miracle, and I am ſure they are far enough out of the Road, and advantages of obtaining it any other Way.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay it is impoſſible, but I dare ſay it is very difficult to find a Head of any faction or ſeparation, who either was not bred up for ſome time, a few days
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101567:23"/>at leaſt for the Credit on't, in one of the Univerſities, or one of thoſe mens Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils who were educated in the times of Rebellion; when a Month made any man of Gifts (for it was no matter for Parts) a Maſter of the Arts of praying <hi>Extempore,</hi> and Preaching <hi>Pindariques;</hi> a Year was ſufficient to proceed to the Grace of Doctor; or by what was then called Grace to make him fit to do the Work of one of their Evangeliſts or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and qualifie him to preach that Goſpel which was able to convert Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to Paganiſm, or ſomething worſe. Or elſe generally you ſhall find them ſuch who have been Reverend Spiritual Curiaſſiers, or Chaplains to ſome of the Rebel Cohorts, or a Diſciple to ſome of them. A Sequeſtrator, Committee-man, or related to, and dependant on them. A Favourite to ſome of the great and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men of thoſe times, or however ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, or ſome of thoſe other ſorts of ignorant, conceited imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Mechanicks; and take the Herring out of which Barrel you pleaſe, for they are all of a price.</p>
               <p>NOW, do not theſe look like men fit
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101567:23"/>to be intruſted with the Management of the Publique Affairs of the Church, and the conduct of Souls to Heaven? of whom ſome were Actors, moſt of them A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors in all thoſe abominable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, thoſe horrible Depredations, and that Infamous Murther of the beſt of Princes, the Lords Anointed, and their Lawful Soveraign; to whom they all ow'd and had many of them ſworn Faith and Allegiance, and have thereby added Perjury to the reſt of their Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crimes.</p>
               <p>WERE not theſe things matters of Fact and ſo notoriously known, that they muſt have Faces of Braſs to deny them, the Charge would be moſt uncharitably ſcandalous: but I deſire no other Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony than that of their own tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and of all the World that knows them, to evidence the Truth as well as Greatneſs of their Crimes.</p>

Of the great Veneration they ſeem to have for the Scriptures, when yet they are directly againſt them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in two Poſitive Commands, to obey Magiſtrates in the State, and thoſe that have the Rule over them in the Church.

               <p>IT is ſome kind of Miracle, that there ſhould be ſuch ill Men, and yet ſuch good and glorious Pretences; but it is a far greater, that after all this, they ſhould be able to gain <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> be followed, admired, countenanced and eſteemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to Adoration, by ſo many Perſons.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101567:24"/>how they come to make ſo many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.</p>

Which manifeſtly ſhews the unreaſonableneſs of their diſobedience. But further, that theſe Governours of the Church have that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority veſted in them and derived upon them, by a continued ſucceſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, is a Truth, which though they may ſtoutly deny; yet they will never be able with all their skill to diſprove, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a new <hi>Index Expurgatorius:</hi> and ſuch a one as muſt purge not only all the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Ancient Fathers, all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of time, all the Acts of the allowed General Councils, but even the Bible, or at leaſt ſome part of it out of the World.</p>
               <p>ALL that they ſay for themſelves to palliate ſuch Notorious Diſobedience, is, That they ought to obey God rather than Men, which is undoubtedly true and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in all ſuch caſes, as that for which it was firſt urged; where the Commands of Men are contrary to the Expreſs Laws and Poſitive Will of God: But a moſt impertinent and frivolous Evaſion, where
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101567:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Impoſitions of Men are either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Will of God; or by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him left altogether undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are therefore abſolutely in the Power of his Deputies, the lawful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to determine, this way or that way, as to them ſhall ſeem moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.

               </p>
               <p>SOMETIMES they will tell us (eſpecially thoſe whole Reaſon convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them of the impotency of the former Plea) that they are obedient ſo far as the Impoſitions are lawful: that is, warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Expreſs Word of God, which is amongſt all Diſſenters the moſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Sanctuary, where their Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſeeks, and, as they think, finds a moſt certain Refuge and ſure Protection.</p>
               <p>LET them now ſhew us, for the proof of this new Tenent, any one place of Scripture, where all Obedience is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only to what is expresly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the holy Canon. If they can, they have better Eyes than all the reſt of the World; and if they cannot, why do they deſtroy their Maxime by their own Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101567:28"/>by yielding Obedience to a Doctrine no-where warranted by expreſs Words or Commands of Scripture? and this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Fortification, in which they think their Diſobedience ſo ſecurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd, will, like the Walls of <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> fall flat in an Inſtant, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
               <p>FIRST, That the Members of the Church ow'd all Obedience to their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Superiours, both in Church and State, before ſome parts of the Scripture were committed to writing; and long before they were collected into one Volume, and ſo communicated to the diſperſed Church. Now, before they were either written or publiſhed, they could be no Rule for their Obedience; which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, was a Duty which they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to perform, both as Men and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, If we conſider, That, though the Scriptures are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently able to make the Man of God wiſe unto Salvation, in point of Faith and Doctrine; yet they are altogether ſilent, as to the particulars of Diſcipline and Government. Some general Rules are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101567:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>laid down; as, That every thing muſt be done with Decency and in Order:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 26, 40.</note> Now the Queſtion is, what is Decent? what Orderly? and what Edifying? The Scriptures cannot be the Arbiters of what they leave undetermined, nay, not ſo much as mentioned: Who muſt then be Judges? Surely thoſe Powers, and that Authority, which are ordained of God; and eſtabliſhed by the Fundamental Laws and Conſtitutions of our Nation: and not theſe Men, nor indeed any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons; who can ſhew us neither Miſſion nor Commiſſion, Succeſſion nor any other Authority, more than they may have obtained by Uſurpation, to be Judges over the Church of God. And their own Practice, when they were in Power, ſhews the unreaſonableneſs of this Plea; ſince what they deny to others, they did then arrogantly challenge to themſelves; <hi>viz.</hi> To determine the Times, and Modes of Worſhip: and in their worthy Directory they did impoſe many things not expresly commanded in Scripture, nor ſo much as incouraged by any ancient Uſage or Cuſtome in the Church of Chriſt. Nay, the very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101567:29"/>and impoſing ſuch a Directory, was by this Rule abſolutely unlawful, as being no-where commanded in the Word of God. And what were all their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, publick and private Faſts, and days of Thankſgiving for their proſperous Wickedneſs, but Times of Worſhip,<note place="margin">Proſperum ſcelus vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> (I dare not ſay of God) of their own, not the Scriptures appointment? So that it makes it very ſuſpicious, that they are of the ſame ſpirit with <hi>Diotrephes;</hi> and that their prating with ſuch malicious words, againſt their Lawful Superiours,<note place="margin">3 S. John v. 9.</note> proceeds from that Ambitious Love which they have to Preheminence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which gives them ſuch an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to thoſe Humilities and due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions which they owe to others.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, the impotency of this Evaſion will moſt fully appear, if we conſider the Nature of Obedience, which is hereby utterly deſtroyed: for the very Eſſence of Obedience does conſiſt (not in diſputing the lawfulneſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but) in a willing and ready put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe Commands in Executions; provided they are ſuch as are not directly contrary to the plainly underſtood and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101567:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>Poſitive revealed Will of God; or to the Univerſal and Common Laws and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Nature and Nations; which none of thoſe, to which Diſſenters are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, can be proved to be. And the Subject of all Obedience, either to the Laws of God or Man, uſually conſiſts in ſuch things as are expedient to be done in order to the publick good, rather than agreeable to our inclinations, which (though under the ſpecious Name of Conſcience) if they may be permitted to be Judges, will emancipate all Mankind, and ſet them free from that Duty which they owe to their Superiors: and it would be no more but pleading this <hi>Corban</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whatſoever is expected from them, and all the Obligation to Duty is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cancel'd. And I would gladly be ſatisfied, if this Doctrine were Univerſally received and put in Practice,<note place="margin">Deus fecit omnia pondere &amp; menſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râ, Sap. c. 11. v. 20, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaw that every thing was veery good,</hi> Gen. 1.31.</note> whether it would not quickly turn the whole World upſide down, and in a few Moments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that Beautiful Order, of which Almighty God was the Primitive Author in Nature; and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, is no leſs in the Church? for God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace, as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101567:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>in all the Churches of the Saints; and that Peace is never to be hoped for, had or enjoyed, without Order, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thoſe Decencies which by a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority are commanded, and which therefore the ſame Apoſtle abſolutely and univerſally enjoins: <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT to ſhew the impracticableneſs of this Opinion in the common concerns of Life, and much more therefore in the Religious, we will ſuppoſe that one of theſe precious Men has Children and Servants, whom he has educated in the fear of the Lord and inſtructed in the Way of Righteouſneſs according to his own Principles. He calls for his Son, and tells him, Son, ſuch a Man owes me a conſiderable ſumme of Money, this is the day for payment, pray go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it for me, to ſupply my preſent urgent occaſions. But replies the Son, Sir, how do I know whether this be a juſt Debt? and unleſs I be ſatisfied in Conſcience that 'tis ſo, I dare neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand nor receive it of him. Oh Son, ſays the Father, Remember your Duty, and the Commandement, <hi>Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:101567:31"/>&amp;c. and from that Text he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es him a long Lecture of the Neceſſity of Obedience, and the many advantages both Temporal and Eternal which do attend it. Sir, anſwers the Son, All this is true, and I am Obedient to you, and Honour you, ſo far as the Scripture warrants me; but I can find no expreſs Command in the Word of God, for this you would have me to do; and unleſs I can, my Conſcience will not give me leave; for I muſt obey that and God rather than Man. Having ſuch ill ſucceſs with his Son, whom he has made ſo good a fencer as to beat him at his own Weapon; he betakes him to his ſervant, who has been ſufficiently taught that he muſt not be an Eye-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but ſerve with ſingleneſs of Heart as unto the Lord: Pray, ſays he to him, go to my Grounds, and take up ſuch a Horſe, carry him to the Fair or Market and ſell him, but not under ſuch a Price. Oh Sir, anſwers the ſcrupulous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Servant, there is to be a Godly Meeting at ſuch a place, and I muſt go to hear ſuch a Precious Man, who teaches the moſt feeling, ſoul-ſaving, heart-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſin-deſtroying Truths. But beſides,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101567:31"/>I know not whether the Horſe be worth ſo much, or whether he is ſound Wind and Limb? and I am afraid leſt I ſhould cheat or over-reach my Neighbour; and indeed I dare not do it, for I would not wrong my Conſcience to gain the whole world, and loſe my own precious Soul. So that, as far as I ſee, if what he calls his Conſcience does but ſuggeſt it, the Man will be the Maſter. And this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience is a moſt excellent thing to cancel all ſuch Contracts as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures, and if it were but as generally received and put in practice, as it is preacht in <hi>London,</hi> the Chamberlain of the City would be eaſed of a great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and Conſcience would make more Free-men in an Hour, than he can do in ſeven Years. It were endleſe to recount all the Inſtances of this Nature which might be brought, to ſhew the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs, ridiculouſneſs, and dangerous folly of maintaining this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>AS for that ſubtle piece of Non-ſenſe of ſatisfying that Duty which they owe to Authority, by Suffering, which they call Paſſive Obedience, I think it is out of countenance already; or if it be not,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101567:32"/>I think it may very well bluſh, when they rank themſelves amongſt Thieves, Murderers, the damned in Hell, and the Devils themſelves, all which are paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedient to the Laws of God and Men: that is, they ſuffer the juſt Puniſhments of their Diſobedience to both.</p>
               <p>THIS may appear a large Digreſſion, and not much to the purpoſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of theſe Papers: But I thought I could not do theſe men juſtice, if after the Character of their Perſons, I did not endeavour to take away, from them this Feather, with which they play ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and tickle both their own Mouths, and the Ears of others.</p>

The ſame Arts made uſe of to promote the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</head>
               <p>LET us now examine by what Arts and Arguments they proceed with ſo much ſucceſs in the Returns they make of their Traffick for Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Money, and Diſciples, and to paſs for ſuch precious godly men, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul-ſavers, both in their Opinion, and the Thoughts of others, who follow them in Multitudes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:101567:33"/>WE muſt therefore underſtand, that what by the In-comes of the late Times, when the Spoils of the Wicked, and the Riches of the Nation ran through their Chanels; and what by the preſent libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Contributions of the Brotherhood; they have as little Neceſſity as Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to enrich themſelves by impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others. What they did before, is both by Time and the ſurpaſſing Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of their moſt gracious Prince, buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Oblivion: So that now they have nothing to do, but to promote the Good Cauſe and God's Glory; for I dare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, that Reſtitution of any thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly obtained by unlawful Means, is no part of their Religion, nor ever raiſed the leaſt ſcruple in the tendereſt of their Conſciences.</p>
               <p>THEY know well enough, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is more prevalent and convincing than all the Precepts and Arguments in the world; and that he that would draw another to be of his Perſwaſion, muſt firſt perſwade him to believe that he is good, and has a great love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his concerns and eternal Welfare: And herein lies their Excellency. It is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101567:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>their greateſt care and conſtant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to manage their Lives and Actions with ſo much cunning and artifice, that Detraction and Envy ſhall have much to do with all their curioſity, to find out any thing in the outſide and viſible part of their Lives whereof to accuſe them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting for their diſobedience to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which though it be unfledg'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the ſhell, yet they are ſo far from eſteeming it criminal or ſinful, that therein conſiſts the only differencing part of their Religion from other Men. And for my part, I will in diſplaying this their Maſter-piece, and what-ever elſe concerns them, do them all the juſtice and reaſon they can deſerve.</p>
               <p>THAT they may therefore appear to be the moſt upright Men in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are not only violent in decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin in others, eſpecially great and ſcandalous, common and cuſtomary ſins, Intemperance, and that Debauchery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the Nation groans; but they are all extreamly vigilant over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: moſt prudent and dexterous not only in avoiding the ſins, but even the occaſions which may lead them into any
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101567:34"/>diſorders: And therefore, though they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear wonderful courteous, and full of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſmiles, yet they will rarely converſe much or long with any Company: and always chuſe to leave behind them the great deſire of their further converſation, rather than to importune and nauſeate with a tedious viſit; coming to ſee you as a <hi>Phyſician</hi> for your Soul; and ſtaying, as if they had more Patients in their Round, and it may be only for the Fee. Nor will they ſo much as come in any place where there may be occaſion or ſuſpicion of Scandal or expence, unleſs in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or in their travels upon the road: they are as ſcrupulous of a Tavern or publick Houſe as a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> who by his great Prophet is forbidden the uſe of Wine. If at any time they fall in acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally with idle or extravagant Perſons; they will either by their ſilence or moroſe ſeverity eſcape their perſecutions; and by a diſcreet Incomplaiſance avoid thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and inconveniences, which hot Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and hard Drinking precipitate ſo many Men into.</p>
               <p>I do not charge them with theſe things as matters of guilt, and if theſe were
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101567:34"/>their only crimes, they were the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſons of the World: And poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the want of this neceſſary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and cautelous Prudence in ſome of thoſe who call themſelves <hi>Sons of the Church,</hi> have done her the greateſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſes; and have given ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to her enemies, as they could not have hoped for from all their own indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious malice and ſubtileſt contrivance: I wiſh they would ſeriouſly conſider of it, and in time reform ſuch of their Actions, as make their Perſons infamous, render their Profeſſion contemptible, their way of Worſhip ſuſpected, and their good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in other things fruitleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.</p>
               <p>BUT to proceed, their very looks are modell'd and compoſed to a ſetled gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and almoſt affected auſterity: Their eyes and hands are in company often lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Heaven, as if they were taken up with holy meditations, or devout Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations. They are uſually ſparing of their Language, and when they ſpeak, it is with ſuch a particular way of a treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſententious deliberation, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords them liberty to weigh every word,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101567:35"/>and ſtrictly examine it, before it paſſes the ſally-port of their lips; which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe adds to the belief that it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that gives them utterance in their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> Prayer, when (contrary to that cuſtom which moſt think is nature in them) they pour out their words, which like <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> ſtruggle for the right of being the firſt-born, as we ſhall take notice hereafter. The greateſt part of their Diſcourſe is about Religious affairs, the great concern of Souls, for which they expreſs an infinite care and tenderneſs. Sometimes they will with paſſionate ſighs and expreſſions bewail the wickedneſs and abominations of the preſent Age; and that not without ſome poyſonous hints againſt the miſcarriages which they will intimate are to be found amongſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the greateſt Rank and Eminency, as influencing the reſt of their Inferiors by Example: and whilſt it may be, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretend to pity them, they really en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make them odious. Their very Habits, leſt they ſhould ſeem incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Pride or Vanity, are uſually mean enough; and for certain ſo remote from the preſent <hi>à la mode,</hi> eſpecially the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101567:35"/>as to appear rather approaching to Antick, if it will but keep them warm, as they tell ſuch as happen to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, that was the original intention of Apparel, and therefore all that they expect from it.</p>
               <p>THEY rarely concern themſelves with ſecular affaires, their Revenues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Free-will Offerings of the People; which they quicken now and then with a gracious Exhortation: To do good and communicate, to diſtribute to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Saints, with which Sacrifices they tell them God is well pleaſed, and no doubt then, but they are: and hereby they receive a treble advantage.</p>
               <p>FIRST, They have a great conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency for privacy and retirement: which they are not ſparing to publiſh they do wholly ſpend, or the greateſt part of it, in Prayer, Meditation, and taking pains to provide Spiritual food for the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, Hereby they gain and preſerve the kindneſs of their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who are ſo far from grumbling at their way of Maintenance, that they look upon it as the only Goſpel-way: and ſeem
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101567:36"/>never better pleaſed with themſelves, than when they have done an Action ſo meritorious, as they pretend to believe the ſupplying of their wants and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is. Though poſſibly (which theſe Men are not aware of) it is becauſe they are not obliged by Law to the payment of thoſe voluntary ſtipends, but are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſtop their hands when they pleaſe; and leſſen or enlarge their Bounty and Liberality accordingly as the Teacher edifies them; that is, as either he flatters their Humors and Fancies in publick or private: Or if there happens any diſlike or diſagreement betwixt them, they may wholly withdraw their Purſes and Perſons from him and his Congregation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to another, as I have ſeen it my ſelf, and do not doubt but it very fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quently happens. And there is no way ſo effectual as this, to make the Clergy moſt <hi>mercenary,</hi> baſe, ſervile and mean-ſpirited, ſo as not to dare to ſay or do any thing which may diſpleaſe a good Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, for fear of loſing both himſelf, his money, and their own Reputation; which of neceſſity follows their being forſaken of any of their Hearers, who will
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101567:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>be ſure to lay the blame of their Change upon the want of ability and unedifying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Teacher, whom they have for thoſe Reaſons left, and made choice of a better.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, Hereby they many times avoid and eſcape the ſeverities of the Penal Laws in their Pecuniary Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; having no viſible Eſtate to levy an <hi>Eſtreat</hi> upon: and as they will not by any Authority be ſuſpended <hi>ab Officio,</hi> ſo they are ſure they cannot <hi>a Beneficio.</hi> One of theſe Teachers meeting the Conſtable, who came with a Warrant to levy twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds, for his holding a Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, of which he was in due form of Law convicted; pleaſantly told him, he might take his Diſtreſs if he could find any thing; but yet, ſays he, I would have you underſtand I do not complain of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</p>
               <p>WERE they to receive their Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> do, by the ancient and eſtabliſht way of Tythes, as their Revenues would be nothing ſo large, ſo they would have leſs time to ſpend in their Studies, and more hatred and ill-will amongſt their Pariſhionees;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101567:37"/>for it has been obſerved, that ſome men of great eminency for Piety, Parts, and Learning, have not yet been able by all thoſe Accompliſhments, to purchaſe the love of their Pariſhes; For which there could be no other Reaſon given, beſides their honeſt Care to take their own juſt Right and Maintenance, according to the direction and appointment of the Laws.</p>
               <p>AND poſſibly we need not ſeek any further for the Reaſon of the common diſreſpect, or contempt of the Clergy: for they lie almoſt under an unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity of being either poor or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: If they will permit either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powerful Greatneſs, or the univerſal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs of the ordinary rank of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to defraud them of the greateſt part of their little Revenues, they may paſs for good, quiet and peaceable men; but muſt certainly be poor and neceſſitous: which will infallibly render them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the eſteem of the greateſt part of the world, which will never leave the humour of paying their Reſpects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the <hi>Quantum quiſ<expan>

                     </expan> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum habet in Arca,</hi> to the greatneſs of Riches, and not of Vertue. And if the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101567:37"/>Clergy endeavours to redreſs this, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recourſe to the Laws, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their juſt Rights, they ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly gain the Character of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, litigious, and covetous perſons, and ſhall not fail to be for theſe falſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations really hated: For all which troubles and inconveniences they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the Doctrine and Practice of theſe Diſſenters, in unſetling the minds of the Multitude in the late Times of Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm: All which they avoid likewiſe themſelves, and are conſiderable gainers by the bargain.</p>
               <p>AND now, what Perſon that looks no further than theſe fair Appearances, but muſt judg moſt advantageouſly of theſe men? And there are not many of their Followers that will give themſelves the trouble of a further Enquiry, or more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now Search and Examination. Nay I am perſwaded, that hereby a great many of them do commonly deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a ſtrong belief of their own ſanctity: And though they do openly avow (if not by their Doctrine, yet by their Practice) and juſtifie the blackeſt of all Crimes, Rebellion, which is as the ſin
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101567:38"/>of Witchcraft; and that ſtubbornneſs, which is as Iniquity and Idolatry, of which they ſo vehemently accuſe others, yet all this is done for Conſcience ſake; and that pretence can by a ſtrange Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, turn the greateſt Sinners into golden Saints, and the moſt horrid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, Sacriledg and Murder, as they would make us believe, into acceptable ſervices to God Almighty.</p>
               <p>THOUGH in reality after all this, they have made no greater advance, and it may be are not yet better than the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees of old,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 26.5.</note> whoſe Sect was the ſtricteſt among the <hi>Jews;</hi> they were as ſtrongly perſwaded of their own ſanctity; they would make as long Prayers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14, 15.</note> and devour Widows Houſes too: They were as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to ſave Souls, nay would do more than moſt of theſe will adventure at, compaſs Sea as well as Land to make a Proſelite; and I fear with the ſame ſucceſs as theſe men do. I ſay they are not yet gotten altogether ſo far, nor are quite ſo innocent: For amongſt all the Crimes our bleſſed Saviour accuſes them of, and condemns them for, and for which he denounces ſo many fearful Woes againſt them, I do not find that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101567:38"/>ever he charges them with the Guilt, or ſo much as ſuſpicion of Rebellion againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or any of his Prefects; or yet with Diſobedience to the High-Prieſt, who was then their Eccleſiaſtical Superior. Nay further, we may well ſuppoſe, that as in their Tithing Mint, Anniſe, and Cummin; ſo they were exact in their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all theſe by the deſign they had to entrap the Holy Jeſus with that Queſtion, whether it was lawful to give Tribute to <hi>Caeſar</hi> or not? they being beforehand ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in themſelves that it was, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved if he ſhould deny it, to accuſe him of a Crime which they were well aſſured would condemn him.</p>
               <p>NOR in truth are they arrived to any higher Pitch, than it is very poſſible for a Heathen, by the meer ſtrength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to perform; and ſome of them went as far in Morality, if we may believe the Hiſtories of their Lives, as it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Humane Nature to go.</p>
               <p>BUT further, to diſcover how great Maſters they are in the Art of Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing to their advantage, and by all ways to gain love both to their Perſons and Perſwaſions: Even Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101567:39"/>the original deſign of which is to make all Crimes odious, as they handle the matter it adds a Luſtre unto theirs. They never fear or feel the deſerved Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of the Laws, but both in publick and private, they cry out as men upon the Rack: and if for their commiting a ſpoil in Gods Harveſt, Juſtice does but take them by the Ears, with their hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous out-cryes they call all the compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Herd to condole with their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and this muſt be call'd a Time of Perſecution, and the ſuffering-days of the Saints. Now the very Word Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſounds ſo heatheniſh and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that it is impoſſible but they ſhould meet with abundance of Pity; and that we know is both the Parent and the Child of Love. And it is no wonder if they glory in theſe Tribulations, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently take the ſpoiling of their Goods, if they can be found, which they are ſure will be reſtored by the Bountiful Pity of their Congregations ſevenfold in this Life, and in the World to come God knows what.</p>
               <p>THAT great conſtancy of Mind with which they appear to ſuffer, they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101567:39"/>may well ſhew, when one hair of their Heads is not toucht. Their frequent talking of reſiſting unto Blood, which I much queſtion, whether they would in Suffering; as for Doing we may from former Experience take their Word; and their many and vehement Exhortations to Conſtancy, begets in their followers an opinion, that they are not at all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the Martyrs of the Primitive Times, or thoſe of later Days: and that therefore they are in the right Way, becauſe they are perſecuted by the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for ſuch are all thoſe, who are not new-caſt in their Mould. And this makes the People redouble their Love and their Bounty: knowing that if he that gives but a Cup of cold Water ſhall not loſe his Reward, theirs ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and full of Glory. Hereby they are ſure they are not of the World, becauſe the World hates them; for they make what they call Perſecution, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſign of the true Church; which is ſo great an Error and Miſtake, that if it be admitted there can be none Falſe; for undoubtedly Philoſophy has not been without its Martyrs, and there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101567:40"/>of Pagan, Jew, Turk, as well as Chriſtian, but has in their ſenſe ſuffered Perſecution; that is, have been oppoſed, condemned, and puniſhed, by the Laws of ſome Times and Places.</p>
               <p>BUT they have another Deſign, and the Project does but too commonly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to their Wiſhes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: for they do not only hereby purchaſe to themſelves Love, Riches, Pity, and Reputation; but they likewiſe inſpire a ſecret Hatred into the People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Magiſtrates, from the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and Official, to his moſt Reverend Grace; from the Countrey-Juſtice of the Peace to Sacred Majeſty it ſelf.</p>
               <p>AND I am the apter to believe this, becauſe in common Diſcourſe, from the Higheſt to the Loweſt of them, I could never yet hear any one of them ſpeak kindly either of the late Bleſſed King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Martyr, or of His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty, excepting for the Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity, or the laſt Indulgence and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration: Whatever Reaſon they had for the one, I am ſure they had ſufficient cauſe for the other; and had they any Remainders of good Nature, Ingenuity, or
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101567:40"/>Generoſity, they would think all their Duty and Service too little to expreſs their ſenſibleneſs and gratitude for that one Gracious Act; whereby they enjoy their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates, all which they had ſo abſolutely forfeited. And though they dare not call the Maſter of the Houſe <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> yet for certain his Domeſtiques ſhall meet with far coarſer treatment: if they are not ſuch as are viſibly inclined to be favourable unto them, but diſcharge their Duty by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Law in execution againſt them; preſently they are Perſecutors, Blood-Suckers, <hi>Neros,</hi> Enemies to God and all Good Men; which all muſt be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe of their Party, who only are Good and Godly.</p>
               <p>FROM hence the People come to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of their Governors and Government: from thence they proceed to wiſh it were otherways; and by degrees grow at laſt familiarly to entertain thoſe dreadful and deſperate Reſolutions, if they have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and Ability, to make what Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations they think good, not only in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious but Civil Affairs; not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but murther Kings, and extirpate
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101567:41"/>Epiſcopacy Root and Branch; and indeed to commit all Villanies and Diſorders. Nor will they ſtick at any thing, which they are pleaſed to varniſh over with the pretence, and only the name of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>THAT this is no falſe Accuſation, or Fiction of my own Fears or Fancy, any Perſon may be eaſily convinced; and it is no more but looking backward to the Times preceding the Fatal Year 1641, and thoſe that followed, till the Happy 1660, and it cannot be denied but that theſe are Real Truths: and that theſe are the certain Trains and Trenches, in which the Undermining Spirit of Phanaticiſm then did, and now does moſt dangerouſly work.</p>

And this they do not out of any real kindneſs which they have for Nobility or Gentry; but to gain Credit, Reputation and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101567:42"/>Strength to their Perſons and Party.

But if he be a good brisk or learned man, one who both preaches and practiſes Conformity, ſober and pious in his Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; then all their Cunning is ſet on work, to find out ſomething that may alienate the hearts of his People from him: For without this due preparation there is nothing to be done, no coming there: And many times this proves no difficult Task; for there being ſo much of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> between the Parſon and his Pariſhioners, they there find a Breach ready made by which they may boldly enter. But if that Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be good; yet ſomething muſt be done, ſomething muſt be found out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101567:45"/>him. If he Preach but once a day, and Catechize in the Afternoons, he is Lazy, Idle, a meer Drone, and has not that care for precious and Immortal Souls as he ought to have: if he Pray as the Canon directs, or in any ſet-form near unto it; he is a Formaliſt, and has not the Spirit of God. A meer Moral Man. But if he be a great oppoſer of them, and their pernicious, dangerous, ſeditious ways and Doctrines, he is a Man of a Perſecuting Spirit, which is utterly contrary to the Goſpel; and that they are ſure will do.</p>
               <p>BUT if it hrppens either that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter be not a Man of Parts, or that he be vicious in his Life, then they have little to do; and their Conqueſt is like <hi>Caeſar'</hi>'s, with a <hi>Veni, vidi, vici,</hi> They come, they ſee, and overcome in an inſtant: and no ſooner can they diſplay their Victorious Enſigns, but the People fall unto them,<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>73.</hi> v. <hi>10.</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſla.

               <p>AND here our <hi>Boanerges</hi> is, it may be,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101567:45"/>courted to fix; which, after having made ſome difficulty to do, only to ſecure to himſelf the Contributions, and ſome other conveniences, he will not fail to do, unleſs he have a call to ſome more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Place. Provided always it be a place Rich and Populous, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken up with fame other prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sect and Faction; which plainly ſhews their Deſign is to ſupplant the preſent Church, more than to propagate that which they call Truth: otherwiſe they might as well endeavour to convert them from their Errors, as the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from their Loyalty and Obedience, which is all they do, or aim to do: And obſerve it where you will, you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee them ſettle in a ſmall or poor Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage: It may be thoſe People have no Souls to ſave, or they are not worth the ſaying, or they muſt travail and take pains for it? and ſince they cannot pay, muſt not have Salvation brought home to their Houſes. I have known one who for ſeveral Years has liv'd in a Place well-ſtockt with a prevailing Sect, and where the Parſon gave him advantage enough, who yet never had any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101567:46"/>gathered there, but ply'd every Lord's Day, and ſometimes in the Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, at a Market-Town ſome Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; and by his pious endeavours, and painful preaching brought the People of that Place, who before he came amongſt them poſſeſt great Unity and Loyalty, to loſe both; and to be of four or five ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided and diſſenting Churches; and ſome of the Mechanicks became ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Teachers, as to contemn, deſpiſe, forſake and vilifie him, who firſt taught them the Trade.</p>
               <p>I cannot forbear ſhooting my Bolt, let them ſhoot the Proverb at me if they pleaſe: Is it poſſible to judg otherways of theſe Men, but that they are his Seedsmen, who ſowed the Tares amongſt the Wheat? who therefore will not ſuffer them to trifle, or ſpend their time to no purpoſe, (no more than he does, who walks to and fro the Earth, like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour), or to ſow that Ground over again, where he has already ſo promiſing a Crop ſprung up, and ſo plentiful a Harveſt towards.</p>
               <p>BUT they have further Policies in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up in Market-Towns, Populous
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101567:46"/>Places, or Corporations; of which,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>17</hi> Car. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> apud Oxon.</note> with very good Reaſon, they are diſabled to be free, unleſs they will firſt ſwear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that Traiterous Poſition of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Arms againſt the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is againſt their Conſcience, becauſe againſt their deſign.</p>
               <p>FOR, firſt, this ſort of People, I mean Tradeſmen, have more ſpare-hours than they deſire; they can write and read, and therefore like the Divertiſement of Books, becauſe it does not call them from the Compter. Induſtry, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of Honeſty are many times their beſt Stock; and therefore they cannot chuſe but love, and like ſuch a Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion, as is like to intitle them to Credit and Cuſtomers; and ſo, by bringing Griſt to the Mill, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility will inrich them; which is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Temptation that induces this ſort of People to affect the Sanctimony of ſome Sect or Faction, which is moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent near about them. And to make it clear that this is true: If ever you find any one of theſe Mercenary Saints Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Wind and Tide of a probable gain; I will be content to be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101567:47"/>thought a Fool for my conjecture. Whereas the Countrey-Swain, whilſt he runs the Yearly-Circle of his hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, has rarely either Time, Learning, or Money to ſpare, to gratifie his own Curioſity, or their expectancies, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be a Free-holder can do them no Service; and little then, if the Lord of the Mannor where he lives be an honeſt Loyal Gentleman: and therefore, they are too wiſe to Angle where the Fiſh is not worth the Bait.</p>
               <p>BUT ſecondly, Hereby likewiſe they come infinitely to propagate their Way; for the Zealous Plum-Smith will not weigh you an Ounce of Pepper, but (unleſs his Shop be full, and then Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt give the Wall to Intereſt,) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Bargain you ſhall have a Pound of Edification, which is the Pack-thread and Paper he binds us his Commodities with: and if he have time, he will give you the Repetition, it may be, out of his Pocket-Book, of what the precious godly Man taught at the laſt Lecture, or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day: or if you be ſo well-bred, as the Phraſe is, he will Treat you with a Pipe of Tobacco, only to perſwade you
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101567:47"/>to come amongſt them, and hear that powerful Man, who is as much beyond their Parſon, (though if he be a Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it may be he is a very good man too) as ſweet-ſcented <hi>Virginia</hi> is beyond St. <hi>Kitts.</hi> The ſimple Country-man thanks him for his Love, and innocently accepts his kindneſs, ſits down, blows out one Smoak, but ſucks in another far more dangerous and intoxicating: he is perſwaded, comes to the next meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hears and likes what he does not underſtand; goes home, tells the fine ſtory to his Neighbours, and decoys them likewiſe into the Tunnel.</p>
               <p>BUT laſtly the great and Principal Deſign of all, and the moſt dangerous if it be not in time prevented, is in ſuch places as have the Choice of Burgeſſes for Parliament, or where there are many Free-holders who have a Voice in the Election of Knights, to make ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as may over-poll the reſt, and in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Parliaments may bring in ſuch a number of Members into the houſe of Commons, as may bring to paſs their Wicked and Treaſonous Deſignes: and I am confident, ſo great has been their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101567:48"/>Induſtrie in this particular, that they are fully perſwaded they are able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their Drift, if they could once come to a new Election; and this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that all the Parties, eſpecially the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian,</hi> are ſo eager for a new Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that they have bid ſo fair for the Diſſolution of the Preſent, from which, being compoſed of ſo many, wiſe, prudent, able, and truly Loyal Gentlemen, the have not the leaſt hopes; but are in the greateſt dread imaginable, that by a Compliance with the neceſſities of the Ring and Kingdom, they ſhould ſtill continue, and not only enact ſomething more ſevere againſt their reſtleſs Machinations, but by ſupplying his Majeſty with Money, cut off all their hopes, if they ſhould come to an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Diſſolution, for a future Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to cramp the Crown, or work upon the Neceſſities of the Son, to ruine him and the Church, as they did with the ſame Engine his moſt Glorious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and that they were in great hopes that this would be a ſhort and the laſt Seſſion of this moſt Loyal Parliament, I think few will doubt who had any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101567:48"/>count (ſo is to obſerve it) what a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Concourſe of all the Factious Heads, eſpecially of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> there was to <hi>London,</hi> againſt the opening of the Seſſions; which appeared like an Army of Hungry Vulturs, hovering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and ready to ſeize upon it ſo ſoon as it ſhould fall, and become a Dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe ready for their deſired Prey. But as their hopes have met with a happy diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, ſo I doubt not but it is the hearty wiſh of every Loyal Subject that long they may; and that this Parliament, for the Honour, Safety, Peace, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Imperial Crown of this Realm, and of the Beſt Church and Church-Government in the Chriſtian World, may long ſit and continue, by the honourable name of the long Loyal Parliament.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> After they are ſettled in ſuch Places, of the Manner of their behaviour in the Meeting-Houſe. Of their <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer. Examined and expoſed to open View. Of the Pretence they make to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101567:49"/>gain Veneration, that they Pray by the Spirit. The ill uſe they employ it in, to make the ſet and appointed Formes of Publick Prayers Nauſeous and Odious to the People. Proved from Scripture and the Expreſs Command of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that it is not of Gods appointment, nor a fruit of the Spirit. By Example of the moſt infamous and abominable Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners guilty of Rebellion and Witchcraft, who had this faculty even to admiration. <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer ſhewn to be a meer Art, the way how they or any Perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a tolerable meaſure of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may attain to it. A probable Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Reaſon, why they fancy themſelves inſpired in theſe Enthuſiaſtick Effuſions.</head>
               <p>IT is now high time to hear what our Man of God will ſay for himſelf: who being accoutred with all theſe perfections, fixed amongſt a Company of Wealthy Tradeſmen, whoſe Ears itch as much after Novelties, as their Fingers do after Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; in deſpight of Laws, Reaſon or true Religion, he advances in the new Meeting-houſe, or a good large Private Room up into the Pulpit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:101567:49"/>HAVING fitted the Cuſhion to the moſt commodious poſture for the eaſe of his Elbows, pull'd out his Handkerchief, with which he intends to wipe off the ſweat; given the Uncanonical Cloak a twitch or two, or if the Weather be hot, laid it aſide, that he may not appear Lazy by thraſhing in his Cloak: and which is a ſure ſign that he is beginning to begin, having roll'd his Eyes about, as if he were falling into a Trance, he gently recovers himſelf into his Prayer, which he faintly begins with a low voice, and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tone, a ſoft and deliberate utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which as the Holy Fire of his Zeal, comes gradually, by Motion, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heat; advances ſtill higher and higher, till at length being throughly warm, like a Pot with too much Fire under it, the Scum of his Brains boils over, and he tumbles out his Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with that Ardor and Precipitation, that every Word treads upon the Heels of another, and puſhes it forward: Nor does it import whether the Expreſſions be Congruous, or it may be Decent, ſo long as they are but paſſionate and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and at every third or fourth Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101567:50"/>(to help the Pump) as loud as he is able, an importunate, Lord! Lord! at which the People are ſtrangely melted, ſome into Tears, ſome into Sighs and Groans; which are the ſpiritual Hums and Plaudite's of a Conventicle; and ſignifie that the Man comes off very well, in Acting his Part upon that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Theater.</p>
               <p>NOW, though he pretends to hate all Forms, yet he is not without a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; and therefore he begins, with Confeſſion: and tells God Almighty a parcel of Notorious untruths in the Name of the People, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him that he knows it too: Lord, thou knoweſt that we have been guilty of all manner of Sins of Omiſſion and Commiſſion, which, it may be, to ſpin out the Hour-glaſs, he gives them a, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of. Some of which (for we will ſuppoſe them Chriſtians, and better Men than he does) the Hearers may be ſo far from being guilty of, that poſſibly this may be the firſt time that ever they were acquainted with their Names; and after this rate he goes on, through the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts of a little Book, which he does
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101567:50"/>not care to own, though he is not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle obliged to it; and makes great and conſtant uſe of it, by Name, The Giſt of Prayer; which till I got a ſight of, I thought they had got without Book, by the help of the Spirit; who, I am ſure, needs no ſuch helps, to help his true Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
               <p>THERE is one general Rule which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives for publick Prayers,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort that firſt of all ſupplications, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for Kings, and all that are put in Authority:</hi> But for all his Exhortation, in a two hours Prayer, firſt or laſt, you ſhall hear but little of that; or if the King be named, his Titles of Supremacy are not recited, or at moſt but half-way: and if he be faintly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Defender of the Faith, it muſt not be ſaid that he is Supreme in all Cauſes, and over all Perſons, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Temporal: for you muſt know, a Presbyter is as great an Enemy to the Supremacy, as a Papiſt; and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges an underivative-power, <hi>in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alibus,</hi> from Chriſt himſelf, to whom the King is but a Subject; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101567:51"/>even in all Temporals <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> to every petty Presbyter. Oh rare and abſolute, and more than Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Church-Tyranny! O moſt excellent Arbitrary Spiritual Government! How conſiſtent art thou with Monarchy! and with that old and true Aphoriſm of State, <hi>Imperium non patitur Duos.</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is incompatible with Rivals, and it muſt be <hi>aut Caeſar aut nullus.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will in general terms pray for Him whom God hath ſet over us; an Expreſſion not without Malice, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that place in the <hi>Pſalms, Set thou an ungodly Man to Rule over them.</hi> They might as well ſay, Whom God has appointed or ordained to be over us, which is a Scripture-Expreſſion. But I fear they do not think or believe the King and his Power to he of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; for if they did, they would endeavour to lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty; and not think it lawful to draw a Sword againſt him, or think ſuch an Oath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful as would tye their Hands from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; though with the nice diſtinction betwixt the King and the Perſon. And
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101567:51"/>let them but make it their own Caſe, I dare ſay, they will not be willing to hang up the Presbyter, for fear you ſhould alſo choak the Man. This they have done, and that they would not be accounted Changelings, is plain by their unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to renounce the Devil and all his Works, the Covenant and Ingagement to live without King and Houſe of Lords.</p>
               <p>AS for our moſt Gracious Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine, James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the reſt of the Royal Family; the Biſhops and Clergy; they never come in their Mouths, or Memories; ſo that, either the Apoſtles general Rule, to pray for all Men, eſpecially for all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, muſt be Iyable to an Exception, if they think fit: or elſe Queens, Dukes, and Biſhops are No-body with them, or not in Authority, that is, a lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and indeed, that is it which they would be at.</p>
               <p>THERE is nothing which has gain'd theſe Men that Veneration, amongſt the Vulgar, which this Impoſture has done; which they endeavour to impoſe upon eaſie beliefs, whilſt they pretend in theſe <hi>Extempore</hi> Effuſions to be immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101567:52"/>by the Spirit of God; which all diſſenters cannot be, and I am afraid none of them are.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.14.</note> The Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of praying with the Spirit, but it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that he means there, that Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, who for the better propagation of the Goſpel gave them utterance in ſeveral Languages: and let me but hear any one of theſe men pray in <hi>Latine,</hi> with that fluency as they do in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and I will believe they pray with the Spirit; though many of them, it may be, if they could, do that neither in <hi>Latine</hi> nor <hi>Engliſh</hi> with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. But the truth is, the Book by which they were taught is not yet made free of the City; and it would puzle <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf, with all his long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded Sentences, to beſtow the Idiom of his Language, in which he was ſo great a Maſter, upon ſome of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which are hardly tolerable true <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. Latine</hi> is a Language familiar enough all over <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſome of them have been educated in it; (though with others it is the Mark of the Beaſt,) and if they had truly the aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it were as eaſie for that to teach them
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101567:52"/>to pray in that Tongue as well as in any other: and when they can, I ſhall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſpare them the trial of <hi>Hebrew, Greek, Syriack, Arabick,</hi> &amp;c. mentioned <hi>Acts,</hi> chap. 2. But it ſuffices they ſay it is by the Spirit, and the People who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ſpeak as the Oracles of God, they believe it: and from hence draw a Concluſion, that thoſe Perſons are the beſt men in the World, having the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in ſuch an extraordinary meaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their Brethren.</p>
               <p>AND this is not the ſmalleſt Engine which they make uſe of, to undermine the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to render the ſolemn Service of God contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: All ſet Forms being, as they ſay, dull, dead, flat, and ſpiritleſs: though they are in a great meaſure the expreſs words of Scripture; and warranted by ancient uſage in the Church, if not from the Apoſtolical Times, at leaſt from the very next and immediate Age unto them. Yet one of their Diſciples did not long ago, in the preſence of ſeveral witneſſes, openly declare, That what we call Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, and the Worſhip of God, was Blaſphemy; and the uſing thoſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101567:53"/>Prayers blaſpheming, not honouring or ſerving God; and ſince they are all learnt <hi>Jurare in verba,</hi> we may well believe he ſpoke as he had heard, the true ſentiments and opinion of his Maſter.</p>
               <p>NOW that we may diſcover the greatneſs of this dangerous and popular Cheat; we will firſt make our Appeal to their own Judg the Scripture. Go we then to him who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and to whom ſhould we go but to him who has the words of Eternal Life? And if we will hear him, he gives us an expreſs Charge againſt Battologies,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Mat.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9.</note> and much ſpeaking in our Prayers; and commands a ſhort Prayer and a Form too: Whatever long Prayers may be, he tells us they look like Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and Superſtition, <hi>But when ye Pray ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi>
                  </hi> &amp;c. <hi>And uſe not vain Repetitions as the Heathens do; for they think they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking. Be not ye therefore like them: but after this manner pray.</hi> How well they obſerved this Rule, we need trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves no further to find out, if we can but remember that it is not yet twenty years ago ſince the Lords-Prayer
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101567:53"/>was accounted unlawful, and by ſome ſcandalous, and indeed was generally out of Faſhion in the Pulpit; and ſo it is ſtill amongſt many Diſſenters: and yet then they would have us believe they pray'd by the Spirit, as well as they do now; and I believe they did, but it muſt be the ſame Spirit which made <hi>Saul</hi> throw his Javelin at the Muſician: For it taught them the ſame Practice, not only to be angry with the Muſick, but to kill the Muſicians, and put all out of Tune. I am ſure it could not be the Spirit of Chriſt which taught them to break and deſpiſe a Command of Chriſt; for he tells us that promiſed Spirit ſhall ſpeak what he hath heard;<note place="margin">S. John 16.13.</note> and I hope they dare not ſay but this Command of our Saviours was one of thoſe things he had head: and was one of thoſe Truths into which he was to lead them.</p>
               <p>FURTHER, if we examine what are the Fruits of the Spirit; they are <hi>love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.22, 23, 24. Eph 5.5.</note> 
                  <hi>faith, meekneſs, temperance, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and truth:</hi> but not the leaſt mention of <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer. If we ſearch what are the Gifts of the Spirit;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101567:54"/>or the Gifts of God? we ſhall find the Gift of <hi>Continency,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1.</note> the Gifts of <hi>Prophecie,</hi> of working <hi>Miracles, &amp;c.</hi> but no <hi>Gift of Prayer.</hi> And where the particular <hi>Gifts</hi> are enumerated, there is not one ſyllable of the <hi>Gift of Prayer.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if it had been a ſpiritual Gift, or a fruit of the Spirit, it would not have been omitted.</p>
               <p>BUT, ſecondly, let us appeal to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: For if this be a fruit of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then all they who can or could thus pray <hi>Extempore,</hi> have the Spirit of God, and are the Sons of God. This is as much a Demonſtration as any in <hi>Euclid.</hi> Now will I bring you ſuch an Army of Saints, with Old <hi>Noll</hi> in the head of them, as ſhall fight and pray with all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Either theſe Saints. S. <hi>Oliver,</hi> S. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> S. <hi>Bradſhaw, &amp;c.</hi> pray'd by the Spirit, and ſo were real Saints; or what they pray'd was not by the Spirit, and ſo they were no Saints, nor <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer any Evidence of the Spirit of God: Now let them take which of theſe they will; I dare ſay they had rather Canonize <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and his praying Legions, than not; only as Affairs now ſtand it is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101567:54"/>ſafe: And if they ſhall refuſe both the Hornes of the <hi>Dilemma;</hi> (as being ſure to be in their ſides, and too ſharp to be handled) they muſt teach us to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and know that they are not juſt ſuch Saints as the others, who had the knack exactly; prayed the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage almoſt <hi>Verbatim;</hi> made the ſame boaſts of, and pretenſions to the Spirit, and I am afraid had the ſame Spirit, the ſame Uſes to make of it, and the ſelf-ſame Ends and Deſigns.</p>
               <p>I might bring many inſtances, but I will only add one, which is ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it will be ſufficient to convince all thoſe who are not reſolved againſt Conviction: and whereby it will appear, that this way of <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer, is ſo far from being a Gift of God, or proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Spirit of God, that it may be a Gift of the Devil; and that ſuch who are almoſt under an irreverſible Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Damnation may have it even in Perfection. The ſtory is thus: At St. <hi>Ives</hi> in the County of <hi>Huntington,</hi> within the Memory of many Perſons yet alive, there was a Woman, whoſe name I do not very well remember, though
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101567:55"/>many in that place very well do: She was one of thoſe, who for diſtinction were then by themſelves called <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> by other <hi>Puritans;</hi> ſhe was a great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of the upholders of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>-Tenents, a conſtant frequenter of Godly Meetings, and Religious Exerciſes: This Woman came to be ſo eminent, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this Gift of Prayer, that ſhe was generally admired, and look't upon as a Saint of the firſt Magnitude: the noiſe of her Fame, and the boaſts of her Party, brought many Neighbouring-Miniſters in the adjacent Counties of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Huntington,</hi> to hear her pray; which ſhe did in that raviſhing manner, that they never parted from her without an Exceſs of Admiration and aſtoniſhment. After ſome time, for what reaſon I am not able to determine, this Holy Siſter went over into <hi>New-England,</hi> as about the ſame time many others did for Liberty of Conſcience; for a while ſhe was there in the greateſt Eſteem, and height of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but the Devil ow'd her a ſhame, and ſhe him a Soul; ſhe was at laſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and accuſed to be a Witch; was brought to a tryal, confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> her guilt, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101567:55"/>that her contract with the Devil was, That in lieu of her Soul which ſhe did conſign unto him, he ſhould aſſiſt her with the Gift of <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer: after which confeſſion, ſentence paſt upon her, and ſhe was accordingly executed, as a moſt abominable Witch. Either now we muſt believe that this <hi>Extempore</hi> Way is not an infallible ſign of the Spirit of God; or that the Devil has the Power of diſpoſing of the Gifts of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>BUT thirdly, I will appeal to theſe very men; let them ſpeak the Truth and ſhame the Devil. Is not this Way of Praying an acquiſition? did not the fore-mentioned Book, or ſome Collections of their own of that nature, out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, often hearing of others, and many ſecret Trials and Exerciſes therein bring them by degrees to theſe perfections? or could they from the firſt Moment of their Converſion pray thus? and they do as punctually remember that time, as what they did Yeſterday: and then if ever they had the Spirit of God; and it was then as well able to help their infirmities as now, and they ſtood more in need of it, and it would have been more viſible and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101567:56"/>apparent that it was not they but the Spirit that taught them how and what to pray: Did they not with much pains and induſtry attain this which they call a Gift? let them deny it if they dare: for if they will ſay they never uſed any of the aforeſaid means to help their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, I will undertake to prove them the moſt impudent affirmers of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Untruth: for many of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are ſentence pickt out of the Bible, which they read often over, with as much reſpect to the getting praying Phraſes out of it, and a great deal more than to be informed of their Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and Men; and it were well if it were no worſe; but there is ſuch a blend of phantaſtical, particular, and uncommon words of their own Mintage, and ſuch a medley of ſingularity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes and Outgoings, and In-dwellings, and I know not what, which like the Wild Gourds ſpoil all the Pottage, and I doubt they will find there is Death too in the Pot.</p>
               <p>I AM the moſt deceived, if for this purpoſe they do not ſtuff their Heads and Memories, with Notions how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101567:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>themſelves upon any ſudden Occaſion or Emergency; and as I am informed by thoſe who have tried both, and therefore have reaſon to know, it is a far greater Eaſe, if a Man has the general Notions of what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſpeak, not to be tied to Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical or Identical Words; but to have a Liberty, to expreſs thoſe thoughts and Notions, according to his preſent Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Fancy: Which if his Tongue be naturally ſmooth and voluble, will make it leſs difficult for him to do it, even to admiration; the charge of Generals being leſs burdenſome to the Memory; than that of Particulars: and beſides it leaves the conceptions an unlimited free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for choice and variation; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords many ſudden hints, which by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followed and improved with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, do many times infinitely ſurprize, both the Speakers and Hearers, with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Novelty and agreeableneſs that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure begets a ſecret Joy, and that Joy dilates and expands the Animal Spirits, which are the true Spirit of <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer; and theſe having a ſtrange Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm and unexpreſſible Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101567:57"/>the Soul, do ſometimes put it into ſuch ſtrange and vigorous heats and raptures, as even makes a Man out-do himſelf and his own expectations. I am perſwaded that the want of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this piece of Philoſophy, which is none of that which the Apoſtle calls vain, and bids beware of, leſt it ſpoil us (though it might, and I hope will, ſpoil ſome of their ill Deſignes) is the true Reaſon why they believe themſelves to be acted in theſe Heats and Tranſports, by the immediate Influence and Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>AND this is the very Art of Prayer; and a meer Art it is, and no Gift, nor Fruit of the Spirit: an Art which with a common Induſtry, provided a Man have a competent ſtock of Confidence, any Perſon may arrive at, and grow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious in: and the ſooner, the more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant he is, becauſe he will be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably more impudent, and conceited of himſelf, his abilities and performances; which is the true Reaſon, why ſo many ſilly Mechanicks, who can hardly ſpeak ſenſe in common Diſcourſe, by hearing others pray at this rate, will ſteal their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101567:57"/>Expreſſions; and with ſome ſmall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Directions, with Time and many private Tryals, grow ſuch ſtrange proficients in the Trade. Nay, and I will engage he ſhall have the Pride (or it may be it is the <hi>Arcanum</hi> of the Craft which they are bound not to divulge) not to confeſs how he came by it; or to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive thoſe who ſhall wonder to hear ſo unlearned a Fellow pray ſo fluently and fervently. And this adds not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle (amongſt thoſe who underſtand not the Intrigue) to the common received Opinion, that it is a Fruit of the actings of the Spirit of God. And the pulling of this Spiritual Inkle out of their Throats, which they would perſwade us came thither by a Miracle, is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and neateſt, as well as dangerous pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Legerdemain,</hi> with which theſe Juglers Hocus the vulgar and incautelous of the preſent Age.</p>

               <p>HAVING now done with the Prayer, let us proceed to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſee what their Doctrines are; for I do not intend to dwell upon their Texts, or trouble them more than they uſually do. As for the Reaſons, though they pretend to raiſe many, yet we ſhall ſee they have very little. The Uſe is what they moſt generally inſiſt upon, and it is the ill Uſe and Application of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101567:58"/>theſe Doctrines that we come now to examine. This is their Form; ſo that I find they are for a Form of Preaching, though againſt a Form of Prayer.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Doctrine upon which they build their Foundation, and by which they eſtabliſh a perpetual Empire over all thoſe who come to be of their Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and which is of the moſt univerſal uſe unto them, is the Doctrine of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and irreſpective Decrees of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, about Election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: A piece of Divinity ſo hard and knotty, that the ſharpeſt Wits and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Judgments have not hitherto been able in any tolerable meaſure to hew, ſmooth or poliſh: And to me it appears, that Almighty God did deſign no great encouragement to our curioſity, having afforded us ſo little light, either from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reaſon, or Scripture, to make a full and perfect diſcovery of it.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101567:60"/>one God: and of a flat downright Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction (as this is) one part muſt of Neceſſity be falſe.</p>
               <p>HAVING by their excellent Talent at <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer, left no ſcruple, but that they have the Spirit of God, and that being the Spirit which muſt lead all thoſe that have it into all Truth: the People are before hand prepared to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down this Doctrine without any chewing or Examination: and in Truth as they have cookt it, it is the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and agreeable Repaſt, to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of thoſe Souls who are ſo happy as to be treated at their Spiritual Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For having firſt laid down as a Poſitive, Infallible and Fundamental Truth, That God from all Eternity did Elect a Determinate Number to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that this number is but ſmall, for it is but a little Flock; <hi>Many are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but few are Choſen or Elected:</hi> the next thing they have to do, is to aſſure them who are their Diſciples, that they are of this Happy Number, who have the Seal in their foreheads, and whoſe names are written in the Book of Life. Now the firſt ſtep to this aſſurance is to uſe the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101567:61"/>means, for Faith comes by hearing the Word of God; though if this Doctrine of unconditional Decrees, be purſued to the uttermoſt, thoſe means muſt be either unneceſſary or nonſence, by being the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed Conditions of an unconditional Decree. Now theſe means, that is, this Soul-ſaving preaching is only to be found amongſt them: Theirs is the Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> where the Sun of Righteouſneſs only ſhines, whilſt all others are in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Egypt,</hi> and grope for the Truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt ſuch Darkneſs as may be felt; and is next to the very Region of the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death, and utter Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>BUT they are too wary to reſt here, or to build ſo weighty a Fabrick upon ſuch a ſlender Foundation: they know that the impious <hi>Herod</hi> heard S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> gladly, and did many things: And therefore before any one can be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he is of the Elect, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo diligent a Hearer, that will not do, unleſs he be able to give an account of the exact, time of his Converſion, and when it was that he was called of God and to God.<note place="margin">S. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20.</note> The Signs of this Calling are Contrition, Compunction, or a Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101567:61"/>of Mind, ariſing from a ſight of their loſt condition, as they phraſe it: And they who are able to inform them of the time of this Call, at ſuch a Sermon, or ſuch a Night after my firſt ſleep (though they did but dream ſo, it is enough) the Lord was pleaſed to call me: All thoſe who can do this, are pronounced from the Infallible Chair, to be in a certain eſtate of Election, the Children and People of God; and after a time of probation (which were needleſs, ſince they cannot fall away) they are ſolemnly initiated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Church, and enter into a promiſe never to return back again to the Tents of the Ungodly, which might as well be ſpared, if the reſt of their Doctrine be true.</p>
               <p>THIS alone were enough to raviſh the hearts of thoſe who do as firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it as the Goſpel, and to fill them with joy unſpeakable and full of glory: But they have a Diſert behind, which cloſes the Banquet far better than the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Deaths-Head; and that is this: That they who are once thus elected, can never finally and totally fall away from Grace, ſo as to be in danger of Hell and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101567:62"/>Damnation;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Calling and Gifts of God are without Repentance:</hi> Could they prove this, and that their Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it were the true and genuine meaning of the Text, this would be a happineſs not inferior to the joys of Heaven; and which for my part I think is only reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to compleat the Felicities of that bleſt place, where, and not before, we arrive there, all fears, tears, and dangers, ſhall be wip't away.</p>
               <p>THIS is their great <hi>Diana,</hi> not the Image which fell down from Heaven, but the Image of Heaven it ſelf which they all worſhip; and which brings them in ſuch fair Revenues, both Temporal and Spiritual (as they think) as outdoes not only the poor hopes of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and all his Fellow-Craftſmen, but the Riches of both the <hi>India's,</hi> which are Dung and Droſs in compariſon of being thus cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly found in Chriſt: And no wonder then if it raiſes ſuch Tumults, when it is oppoſed, or in danger of being loſt.</p>
               <p>THERE can be no Doctrine more pleaſing to credulous and fanciful people, as moſt of their Diſciples are; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo luſcious is the high reliſh of it,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101567:62"/>that thoſe who have once gotten a ſay of it; are difficultly, if ever, perſwaded to abandon it, or in compariſon of it not to contemn and deſpiſe all others. But as it is thus infinitely pleaſing above all the Fruits in the Garden, ſo like that treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Apple, it is for that very Reaſon of all others the moſt pernicious, both to the Souls of men, the quiet of any Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ſafety of any Government that dare oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>I DO not intend to attempt a long and ſolemn Confutation of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; in regard it has already been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently done, by the Pens of many great and learned Names: I will only therefore uſe a little of their own method, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Foundation, and leave the reſt of their prodigious <hi>Babel</hi> to ruine it ſelf by the weight and ſtreſs they have laid upon it.</p>

               <p>SHOULD we grant them their firſt Poſition, that there is but a ſmall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Number who are Elected, yet if we ſhew that their Touch-ſtone is falſe, and will not diſtinguiſh Gold from Braſs, all the Virtue and Conſolation, and that vain Joy in believing, will immediately vaniſh, in all thoſe who are not reſolved with the ſtrength of fancy, and prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed Imagination, to ſupply the want of Reaſon: and for ſuch, we muſt commit them to Time and <hi>Hellebore,</hi> the Phyſick of mad-men, for a Cure.</p>
               <p>NOW their great and infallible ſign of Election, being a knowledg of the time of their Converſion, accompanied with Compunction and Contrition, a ſenſe of Sin, and ſorrow for it; It is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any Perſon at one time or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, not to have experienc'd all this; eſpecially if they have ever met or been acquainted with Sickneſs, Danger, or any remarkable afflictive Accidents: Or if
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101567:63"/>they have formerly been groſs and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinners, as 'tis obſerved many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their Converts (eſpecially of the frail Sex) have been: for ſin will at one time or other throw off his gay Habit, and maſquerading Jollity, and appear not only with its proper uglineſs and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but with the frightful attendants of Death, Judgment and Eternity, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Puniſhments of the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhapes that Imagination grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Reaſon and a juſt Fear, or a preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, is able to invent. And there are few Spirits ſo flinty, but ſuch black and fearful Apparitions will make a very ſtrong impreſſion upon: ſuch as may eaſily produce all the fore-mentioned ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and many more and greater.</p>
               <p>BUT we will go further with them, and ſuppoſe all this conviction has been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the Means, by hearing a ſin-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, a heart-convincing Sermon, which has impreſt guilt upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, with the higheſt Aggravations, and greateſt terrors. After all theſe ſorrows and Agonies of Spirit, which they make the certain Indications of the new Birth, or Regeneration; nay, after open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101567:64"/>publick Repentance, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond all that, the Perſon may ſtill be in a ſtate of Reprobation. <hi>Judas</hi> he repented,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.3, 4.</note> nay, his contrition and conviction, his ſenſe, ſight, and ſorrow for his ſin, was ſo great and ſtrong, that he publickly confeſt he had ſinned in betraying the Innocent Blood: Nay, he went yet further than any of theſe Men ever did, that I have heard of, for he made reſtitution of what he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully gotten; he caſt down the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought thirty pieces of Silver in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before them all, and by his clearing the Innocent, did endeavour to make what reparation, for his Crime, he was capable of; and yet thought not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for he went away and hanged himſelf. I would not have any of them follow him ſo far; though it is affirmed ſome, driven by theſe deſperate Doctrines, have, and 'tis a Miracle that many more do not follow his Example. But for all their Marks, I believe they have not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them read <hi>Origen</hi> (becauſe he is one of the Fathers, who amongſt them paſs for a Company of ſcandalous Popiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected old Gentlemen) nor will they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101567:64"/>eaſily be perſwaded with him to allow <hi>Judas</hi> the benefit of his Clergy; or take him to be one of their number who ſhall be ſaved: and yet his Title to it, by all their ſymptoms, is as fair as any they can make; and for all his being a <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> being able to give ſo punctual an account of the time of his Call and Converſion, and there being an impoſſibility of final falling away from Grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> I cannot tell what way, by their own Doctrine, they will be able to exclude, even this Son of Perdition, from a certain ſhare and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Heaven.</p>
               <p>BUT beſides him, I doubt not but there are thouſands who if they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly confeſs, have had great ſorrows, ſtrong Convictions, and horrible Agonies of Mind, from the frightful apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Hell and Damnation, which are always terrible to the thoughts of Men. Nay, I do not queſtion but they may have ſeriouſly repented, and made great reſolutions, and ſome vigorous attempts towards amendment and reformation in their Lives: who nevertheleſs, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22.</note> after they have eſcaped the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the World through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the great danger of this Doctrine as they apply it. Firſt, to themſelves; It fills them with a groundleſs and falſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the goodneſs of their Spiritual Condition; makes it almoſt impoſſible to convince them by Reaſon or Scripture, though they live after the Fleſh, in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Envy, Malice, Diſobedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that they have the Spirit, and live
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101567:65"/>after the Spirit, and are new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. It fills them with Pride, and Phariſaical contempt of others; puts them into Security, the moſt dangerous Condition a man can be in.</head>
               <p>NOW could I make a Sermon like one of theirs, and run on to nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenthly, Beloved, in ſhewing the Dangers of this Doctrine; but I have no Deſign to wire-draw my Application, as they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually have in theirs: I will therefore content my ſelf to recount the Chief, from which the reſt do almoſt natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flow, and may be moſt eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd.</p>
               <p>FIRST, We will conſider the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Influences this Doctrine has upon themſelves.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, The Ill Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it has upon them, as they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any Private Community, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Village, Town or Corporation.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, The Dangerous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects it has upon the Church.</p>
               <p>LASTLY, The fatal and portentous aſpect it has upon the State and Civil Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:101567:66"/>WE will begin with the deſperate. Influences this Doctrine has upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Hereby, poor Souls! (to uſe their own word) they are in the greateſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of deſtroying themſelves, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Eternal Salvation: to which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing can contribute more than an unwarranted Confidence, and groundleſs ſecurity. When they cry Peace, Peace, to themſelves, then are men in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt danger of ſudden Deſtruction. They make not the leaſt queſtion, but that they are of the Number of the precious Ones, the Elect of God; and are ſure that theſe Elect can never fall away from Grace, or be totally and finally diveſted of an undoubted Title to Heaven and Happineſs: which Doctrine, however ſome of them in words may deny, and all of them in their Application do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally confute; yet does moſt unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably follow the other of abſolute and unconditional Decrees; which all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters in reality hold, whilſt they affirm themſelves the only People of God, and all others Reprobates. And therefore in this aſſurance of their being the Choſen and Elect of God, they poſſeſs the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101567:66"/>inward Peace and Tranquillity imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: The Conſideration of that Infinite Love of God, and his free and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace to call them, and paſs by the reſt of Mankind; this particular and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved favour, which they wholly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize and appropriate to themſelves, begets in them a Reciprocal Love to God: for if God ſo loved them when they were Enemies, as to ſend his only begotten Son out of his boſom, purpoſely to ſave and redeem only a few out of the whole Maſs of Mankind in the World, of which few they are a part, when, in the mean time, he paſſes by Millions more Wiſe, Mighty, and Learned, without taking notice of them, or doing any thing for them, more than to harden their hearts, that ſo he may take occaſion to condemn them for refuſing that Grace and Mercy, which by reaſon of his Previous Decree they could not poſſibly accept, How much then are theſe obliged to God for making ſuch a difference? How ought they to love God? This Love ſtill increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their confidence and ſecurity: they are therefore ſure that this is the Hope which maketh not aſhamed, which is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101567:67"/>the Anchor of the Soul; becauſe the Love of God is ſhed abroad in their Hearts: and at laſt they arrive at ſuch a certainty as will not permit them to have the leaſt doubt, but that they are the Veſſels who are choſen to Honour, who by this Grace are fitted for future Glory. This fills their Earthen Veſſels brim-full of Satisfaction, and a Joy which upon all occaſions runs over at their Mouths; and to which they will tell you, could you but once come to experience it, all other Comforts are far inferiour: Now they have ſweet Communion and Fellowſhip with God; their Converſion is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; nay, Heaven and all that is good and great, ſtoops down to dwell with them. And thus theſe things, which are nothing but the pure Effects of this ſtrong Imagination, that they are the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, are to them infallible Signs of their Election; and they think the Spirit bears witneſs with their Spirits, that they are the Sons of God, by giving them this Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and in believing: and ſo the Mother begets the Daughter, and the Daughter begets the Mother, like the Riddle of Ice and Water, <hi>in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum;</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:101567:67"/>a <hi>Simile</hi> not at all unfit for ſuch a ſlippery and unſtable Principle, as is the Foundation of this their Perſwaſion. But the miſchief is, that all that ever you can ſay or do, to repreſent unto them the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they are in, ſignifies little or nothing, for they look upon you to be carnal, and not able to diſcern ſuch ſpiritual affairs as this is.</p>
               <p>BUT if you chance to tax them with Hypocriſie, which is but too common, you cannot do them a greater kindneſs; for that convinces them beyond all other Arguments, and confirms them in the opinion of their own truth and ſincerity, and that you are miſtaken, ſince they know and do ſenſibly feel thoſe real Effects of Joy and Pleaſure, which you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelf and them they do but counterfeit.</p>
               <p>NAY further, they are ſo far from believing any body but themſelves, that they will not believe the Scripture, if that would perſwade them that they do not walk in the Spirit, or are not led by the Spirit; or that they have not yet put off the Old Man, and the former vain Converſion, and crucified the Fleſh,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101567:68"/>and the luſts or deſires and affections thereof.</p>
               <p>CARRY them to that place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> where he tells us, what are the luſts of the Fleſh, and what are the fruits of the Spirit:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, Adultery, Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, Idolatry, Witcheraft, Murders, Drunkenneſs, Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and ſuch like;</hi> all theſe they will tell you they have put off, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new men; and all this we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe in the outſide of their lives, they have quitted ſome ſcandalous and notorious ſins, which before they were guilty of; and have got an affected way of hard words, and talking about Religion, ſome auſterities of life in which they think all ſanctity conſiſts, all which may be nothing but a Form or Faſhion of Godlineſs; and in which they have not yet out-done many Heathens, who were ſtrangers to Grace; and I am ſure in their opinion ſhall be ſo to Heaven. But though they ſtill live, and it may be more than ever, in the moſt notorious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, and daily practice of Hatreds, or Enmities, Variance, Emulations, Wrath,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101567:68"/>Strife, Seditions, or Factions and Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Hereſies, Envyings, Murthers, if not of mens Perſons, yet of their Fame and Reputation, which is as dear and tender as life; all this is nothing: Tell them as oft as you pleaſe, as the Apoſtle there ſays,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Of which things I have told you before, as alſo in times paſt, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> they will neither believe him nor you.

Tell them, that they who reſiſt the Supreme Magiſtrate, his Power and Authority, his Laws and ſubordinate Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Juſtice, <hi>ſhall receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves damnation;</hi> they will anſwer, they ſhall not, if they do it for Conſcience ſake: He ſays,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>they muſt be ſubject for Conſcience ſake;</hi> they ſay they muſt not be ſubject, but ought to do as they do, and be diſobedient: He tells them there is a neceſſity for it, <hi>wherefore ye muſt

How true they are, may be a queſtion: but it is none, whether they are not a ſort of unmannerly Believers, thus to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict an Apoſtle, nay all the twelve, and Chriſt too, if they ſay not what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them.</p>
               <p>TELL them they deſpiſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">2 <hi>S. Pet.</hi> 2.5.</note> and therefore are preſumptuous, ſelf-will'd, ſuch who are not afraid to ſpeak Evil of Dignities, of the things they underſtand not, ſporting or pleaſing themſelves with their own deceivings, or with deceiving themſelves, and that for theſe things they ſhall utterly periſh, they will not believe it concerns them; but though they are manifeſtly guilty of the Crimes, they will be ready to throw the puniſhment there or elſewhere mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon your back.</p>
               <p>IF St. <hi>Jude</hi> tells them there is a Woe againſt them,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Jude</hi> 11. <hi>Num.</hi> 16.</note> and that they ſhall periſh in the gain-ſaying of <hi>Corah,</hi> which was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101567:69"/>diſobedience to, and raiſing a Mutiny againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Prince and the Prieſt, and by the ſame Arts and Ways which they uſe, telling them they took too much upon them, ſince all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were holy, the Lords People, and had all, who were gifted, as good a right to Govern as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to be Prieſts and offer Incenſe as <hi>Aaron;</hi> pretending Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Reformation, which has we ſee been the old Stratagem to lead on Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; 'tis all one, they will no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you, than if you quoted the <hi>Aleho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> to confute them. And thus in a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent aſſurance of Heaven and Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joys (which they think themſelves aſſured of by virtue of their Election) they ride Poſt (and there is hardly a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſtopping them) in the way that leads to everlaſting miſery and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>NOR is the Doctrine of the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of their final falling away from Grace, leſs dangerous than the former, of which it is indeed a neceſſary Branch; for hereby they receive encouragement to commit many leſſer ſins; and under the pretence of Failings, the imperfections
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101567:70"/>and frailties of Fleſh and Blood, to paſs over with a ſlight Repentance many wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Offences; and take any ſlight remorſe for a reconciliation with God: Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe he will not ſuffer them to lye in ſin, becauſe they cannot dye in it, brings them to Repentance; and how ſlender ſoever it is, he will accept of it from theſe his particular Friends and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. And thus they ſlightly heal their Wound, and with an imperfect Cure skin over that Hurt, which feſters and gangrenes underneath, and is ſo much more dangerous, by how much the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it lyes, and they are leſs ſenſible of it. If this be not an Effect of this Doctrine very frequent and common, ſure I am it may be, being the proper and natural Reſult of it; and which, as in the former, does likewiſe compleat the Danger they are in, all Arguments are in vain that are employed to convince them of their Errour.</p>
               <p>I have read of a certain Page to a great Nobleman in <hi>France,</hi> who in the high Phrenſie of a Fever fancied himſelf the King of <hi>France;</hi> and during his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <hi>Delirium,</hi> was by his Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101567:70"/>accordingly treated and humour'd: And I have heard of many Lunaticks and Melancholy perſons who have really fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied themſelves to be Mighty Monarchs: It were an eaſier task to induce thoſe to believe the contrary, (for Time and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines have done that) than to perſwade theſe men, that they are not certain Kings and Prieſts in Reverſion; though that latter is a title they love ſo little, that it is a queſtion whether they will accept of any place in Heaven, if they cannot have it without that Name, which they profeſs to hate, and never uſe but in deriſion of ſuch who are ſo on Earth, and in the higheſt probability of being ſuch hereafter in Heaven. But amongſt all thoſe who are upon Record in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of diſtempered Brains, I know no Story that parallels that humour ſo exactly as his, who uſed to ſtand upon the <hi>Pyraeum</hi> or famous Port of <hi>Athens,</hi> and ſeeing the Wealthy Merchants Ships arrive there from ſeveral places of the World, he wonderfully pleaſed himſelf with the belief that they were all his own; all their rich Cargo's brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only for his uſe or pleaſure, when in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101567:71"/>truth he had not the leaſt ſhare or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in any of them. So theſe men fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think that God Almighty has ſtor'd up all the Treaſures of his Wiſdom, Riches, and Mercy, only for them; that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays all his Goodneſs and Bounties upon the World for their ſakes; and ſo arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly do they ingroſs all, that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that Heaven, and all thoſe inconceivable Pleaſures, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Glories, were from all Eternity purely and ſolely intended and created for them.</p>
               <p>THERE is ſo much pleaſure in the enjoyment, and ſo little ſatisfaction in renouncing this Opinion, that though it be but a meer Cloud, they will hug and embrace it with that Ardor, and thoſe Paſſionate Tranſports, as if it were a real <hi>Juno,</hi> a Celeſtial Beauty; and would ſome of them ſcarce be divorced from it, but with their Lives; which I am perſwaded they would make no difficulty to quit, rather than the pleaſing Dream; and ſo much the more willingly, becauſe they believe Death to be the Under-She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of Heaven, who is to put them into immediate Poſſeſſion of thoſe dear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101567:71"/>thoſe unexpreſſible Joys, which they do with ſo ſtrong an Imagination phanſie are there laid up for them in ſtore.</p>
               <p>AFTER all this I would not be thought to be of their Faith, who believe there are no ſuch things as aſſurance of Heaven, Joy in believing, or Comfort of the Holy Ghoſt. I am very well ſatisfied that theſe are not Fictions, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt certain Truths; and that there is a great poſſibility of enjoying a great Meaſure of them: But this Bleſſed Hope which is the Anchor of the Soul, muſt be fixed upon firm and ſolid Cround; otherwiſe it will in our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtreſs and neceſſity ſlip and come home to us, and indanger our Wrack upon the Rock of Deſperation; and therefore, this Joy and Comfort muſt be built upon our Willing and Univerſal Obedience to all the Laws of God, and Commands of the Goſpel, in deſire, will, intention, and endeavour, which through Faith in the Merits of Chriſt, is only able to fill the Devout and Pious Soul with thoſe true Joys, and that Peace of God, which paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all underſtanding: and this Univerſal
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101567:72"/>Obedience I am ſure theſe Perſons cannot juſtly pretend to, ſo long as they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in that manifeſt, wilful diſobedience to their Lawful Superiors both in Church and State, which is ſo plainly contrary to the Will and Poſitive Command of God.</p>
               <p>BUT further, this Doctrine fills them with a ſpiritual Pride and Opinion of themſelves, which makes them deſpiſe all others: and certainly is one true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Separation, whileſt though it may be their Words do not, yet their Actions ſpeak it out plain enough in the Language of thoſe in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which ſaid, <hi>Stand by thy ſelf, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>theſe are a Smoak in my Noſtrils, and a Fire that burneth all day,</hi> ſays God of theſe Pretenders to Holineſs, and Breakers of Union in his Church: Good encouragements to Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration! and to perſwade this ſort of men that they are in God's Favour, and his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and Choſen ones, he gives ſo good a Character of them, and that their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo grateful to him. Sure they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look this Text, or never ſoberly conſider of it, or meaſure themſelves by it; for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101567:72"/>if they did, God Almighty would not have ſo many unrequired Phariſaical thanks from them, as I queſtion not but he has, That they are not as other Men, ſo, or ſo; or even as this ſuperſtitious, Idolatrous Church of <hi>England</hi> Man; who for all that, with his devout Litany, and humble <hi>Lord have mercy upon me miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sinner,</hi> is in the judgment of him who ſhall be Judg of the quick and the dead, like to go up to his Houſe juſtified ſooner than the boaſting Phariſaical <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Separatiſt, notwithſtanding the large ſelf-juſtifying Inventory, of his own Perfections and Performances. There are few but would be of my judgment in this particular, that theſe men are ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puft up with this wind-Tympany of Pride, if they had but convers'd with them; and ſeen how big and ſwell'd they look with ſelf-conceit; or if they had but heard them vilifie, leſſen, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all others, upon whom the beſt their Charily can beſtow, is a little ſcornful Pity; Alas! poor Souls! they are in blindneſs, Errour, and Ignorance, and do not ſee thoſe ſaving Truths which

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the ill Conſequences this Doctrine has upon the private Communities where it comes. From hence proceeds a certain breach of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity. No People ſo addicted to Debates, Envyings, Strife, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings, Whiſperings, Slanders, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cenſuring all who are not of their Way to be Reprobate, as are the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs and Atheiſm hereby extremely propagated; they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the deareſt Eriends, and by creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Houſes, and beguiling ſilly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, divide thoſe whom God had join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together; they are curious buſie-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in eſpying out the faults of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; which they publiſh to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves appear the Elect, and all others Reprobates. All this is done to fit them to act upon the publick Theatre of the World which they practiſe in private Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, or where ever they dwell.</head>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:101567:73"/>FROM Themſelves, let us paſs to their Neighbours; and there we ſhall ſee the ill conſequences this Doctrine has upon them as they are Members of any Community or private Society of Men. Hereby the Unity of the Spirit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.3.</note> which is the Bond of Peace and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is utterly deſtroyed; and whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Doctrine once enters, there does immediately follow, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to his <hi>Corinthians, Debates, Envyings, Wrath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Strifes, Back-bitings, Whiſperings, Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Tumults;</hi> innumerable Diſputes, great heats in diſcourſe, and coolings in Charity; ſtrong arguings, though weak Arguments, from theſe men of perverſe minds, condemning, cenſuring, judging, reproving and reproaching all their Neighbours, who will not join with them, and by running into the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Spiritual Riots, unlawful Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Conventicles, or Aſſemblies, under pretence of ſerving God, become new Men, as they believe and ſpeak them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be: all thoſe who look not through their Opticks, are blind, the Wicked, and Reprobates. If for this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101567:74"/>talkative and troubleſome humours, any of their Neighbours reprove or rebuke them, preſently it is becauſe they know nothing of God or of goodneſs: If here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they purchaſe the averſion of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or more Judicious, the Prudent and Ancient, who will tell them it was not ſo in their time; but there was more true love, faith, and honeſty, when there was leſs diſputing about Religion; when men went all one way to the Church and Heaven; and that it was never a good world ſince they came into it: Oh! theſe are your formal Moral men, who are ſetled upon the Lees: and hereby they fortifie themſelves in their Errors, becauſe they know the world muſt hate them; which Hatred they make another infallible Sign of the true Church; and which is juſt ſuch another as the former Mark of Perſecution; and if one or both of theſe are true, all manner of Thieves, Robbers, Murderers, and combined Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, muſt undoubtedly be of their true Church; becauſe they are hated of all men, except their Confederates; and juſtly perſecuted for their contempt and breaking of the Laws, as theſe men are,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101567:74"/>who for all their fine pretences, are no leſs Malefactors, nor leſs dangerous to the publick welfare of the State, than the other; and I am ſure far more in one ſenſe, becauſe they are more numerous and of worſe deſign: And whatever they may ſay, it is for that danger which the natural Principle of Self-preſervation teaches all men, it is for their doing ſo many ill Offices, ſetting Families and whole Towns together by the ears, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the peace and quiet of all their Neighbours; it is for theſe and ſuch like uncharitable practices, that they deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly pull thoſe averſions upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and not as they vainly pleaſe themſelves, for their being Religious, which thoſe that ſee through them, and their Form of Godlineſs, to their wicked Intentions, ſay they cannot ſee any true Religion in them at all; and cannot hate them for what they are not guilty of.</p>
               <p>NOR does this a little advance the encreaſe of Atheiſm amongſt us; and it may be, we need not ſeek much further, for the true Reaſon of the great and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Decay of Chriſtian Piety in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age. I have known in ſome places
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101567:75"/>thoſe who were of no particular Faction, nor had liſted themſelves under the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards of any Party, who yet forſook the aſſembling of themſelves together at the Church, the Prayers, and Sacraments; for which I could never hear them give any other account, but that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to know which was the right Way to Heaven, or the true Religion, whilſt ſo many different Opinions pretend with an equal Confidence that they are in the Right, and all others wrong: and this ſort of People wanting both Will and Abilities to judg, are eaſily perſwaded to diſpence with all Religious Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, their natural inclinations having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver very ſtrongly bent them that Way; and ſhould the ſucceeding Age make but as conſiderable a ſtep towards Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, as the preſent has done, we ſhould ſtand in need of a Second <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea,</hi> to convert our Poſterity to the Chriſtian Faith, as 'tis ſaid the firſt did our Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>NEITHER has this Infection ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only upon the vulgar, but even thoſe perſons who have been able to fly from other Plagues, have been ſurprized by this
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101567:75"/>Contagion; and poſſibly <hi>Leviathan,</hi> who is ſo much accuſed for debauching green heads, has not made ſo many <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to Atheiſtical Principles amongſt the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and unſettled Minds of young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, as the many Diſputes and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties which of late have by our Diſſenters been occaſioned about which is the true Religion; where whileſt every one boldly challenges the ſole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Truth, they come all at laſt to be ſuſpected of Falſhood; and amongſt ſo many gliſtering and well-ſet Counterfeits and Pebles, the true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Diamond, by the difficulty of diſcovery, is in danger to be miſtaken, if not abſolutely loſt. And the young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, whileſt he makes it his Paſtime as much as Cock-fighting to ſet the Doctor of his Pariſh, as he calls him, and a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Anabaptiſt,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian</hi> into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about Religion; though he fancies the Rencounter very pleaſant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gets a fine Scene of Divertiſement, yet he certainly loſes all that little good Opinion which before he had of Religion; and this together with his own looſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and the faſhionable humour
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101567:76"/>of being irreligious, eaſily perſwade him, that it is nothing but a fine Device of Politicians, to keep the lower part of the World in awe. Or if he has read the Poet, he believes him more than the Goſpel, when he tells him—<hi>Primus in Orbe Deos Timor fecit.</hi> The Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Religion, was either Fear or Fancy. And are not theſe glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, occaſion'd and found, out by this New Goſpel-Light?</p>
               <p>BUT to proceed; theſe perſons are always curious and inquiſitive to find out the moſt ſecret Crimes of others amongſt whom they live; and will never fail to publiſh that in the open ſtreet, and upon the houſe top,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.15.</note> which was done in a corner; and they are ſo far from the true Chriſtian Way of private admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on directed by our Saviour, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waiting for Reformation by thoſe Degrees, they proceed immediately to a <hi>Dic Eccleſiae,</hi> and tell it to their Church upon the firſt diſcovery.</p>
               <p>LIKE the wily Serpent, they do commonly begin the Temptation with the Woman, as being the weaker Veſſel, yet having a ſtrong Aſcendant and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101567:76"/>upon the Husband: and hereby do not rarely Verifie the Apoſtles prediction, when they creep into houſes and lead Captive ſilly Women, laden with Sins, led away with divers Luſts: and it is the common opinion, that it is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to find amongſt their Converts, more Women who either are or have been of ill, or at leaſt ſuſpected Fame, than in many other places which go under a harder Cenſure. But the good Woman becoming a New Creature, religiouſly cheats her husband to help to maintain the Speaker; the Man firſt ſuſpects, and after a little Time diſcovers the Intrigue of his Wifes paying for this new invented Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of her Ears; and as well he may, is not a little angry or diſpleaſed at it. She tires him with perpetual Lectures, Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, Admonitions and Importunities; which makes his Houſe or Shop uneaſie to him, and either does, or very probably may induce him to ſeek more agreeable Converſation abroad; and whilſt he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to avoid her <hi>continual drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in a rainy day,</hi> as the wiſe man calls the Perſections of a Contentious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by chuſing ſuch places and perſons
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101567:77"/>for his Divertiſement, he may endanger the Ruine of his Soul, Body, and Eſtate. And ſurely next to the debauching a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into forbidden Embraces, I think this alienating of thoſe two, whom God hath made one, and no perſon has power to put aſunder either in Body or Mind, is a diſpleaſure that muſt needs be the moſt ſenſible Affliction to both Parties, and ſo much the more, if formerly there has been an entire Love and kindneſs; when they ſhall come to be ſo far eſtranged as to live in perpetual jars and diſcords; and whileſt they both ſtrive to ſave the others Soul, run a manifeſt hazzard of loſing both; and do moſt certainly loſe one of the greateſt deſigns and ſatisfactions of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which is, that they may be mutual helps and comforts one to another. The Heathen Poet could have taught them better Doctrine, where he tells them:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Foelices ter &amp; amplius,</l>
                  <l>Queis irrupta tenet Copula</l>
                  <l>Nec malis divulſa Querimoniis.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the good Women the way to convert their Heathen Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101567:77"/>is by their chaſte Converſation coupled with fear to offend them, and not by perpetual ingrateful Curtain-Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
               <p>THE wiſe King tells us, <hi>ATale-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er maketh ſtrife;</hi>

But above all, their aſperſions are thrown upon their Lawful Miniſter, if poſſible to make him odious to the People, which they know if they can effect, it will be no hard matter to bring them into their Confederacy. And having left him, becauſe he will not leave the Church and his Duty, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear himſelf to pleaſe them, that they may appear to have ſome Reaſon too for their deſerting of him, they will not ſtick to vilifie, contemn, deſpiſe, defame, and ſcandalize, by all the ways they can invent, true or falſe, it matters not: and herein their cunning is not leſs than their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101567:78"/>malice; one blow at the Root, being worth a hundred at the Leaves or Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: and rather than fail, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe is to be had, they will content themſelves with ridiculous Improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. A Clergy-man of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance being call'd up to <hi>London</hi> upon the diſpatch of ſome emergent and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affairs of his; having, it ſeems, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fix upon him beſides, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that during his ſtay there, he had his Pocket pickt at the Play-houſe, of a conſiderable Sum of Money; which was, as they would have people believe, a moſt remarkable Judgment upon him for his Vanity; but a far greater Untruth, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as he ſolemnly proteſted to me) never had that common piece of ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune at <hi>London,</hi> or any where elſe, in all his Life; nor for ſeven years before ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen a Play; though he thinks it far better, and more lawful, than one of their Conventicles, where the Teacher picks the Money out of their Pockets, all their Duty, Loyalty, and Allegiance, out of their Hearts; and if they do not in time repent, they are in the greateſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:101567:78"/>danger of having the Devil pick their Souls out of their Bodies.</p>
               <p>IT were endleſs to recount all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances they make where-ever they come: and this being but the Prologue to greater Miſchiefs and Inconveniences, we will proceed to them; though to keep their hands in ure, they are like the Gentlemans Servant, who being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by his Maſter to be ſo light-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd, that he never went any whither, but he ſtole ſomething before he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; he gave him a ſtrict charge not to meddle with any thing at a Houſe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was going to make a Viſit; at his coming away, the Fellow took up a handful of the Ruſhes with which the Hall was ſtrow'd, and put into his Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; and his Maſter demanding why he did ſo, he made anſwer, it was to keep his hand in ure. So theſe men will play at ſmall Games, Heads and Points, in their own Pariſh, rather than ſtand out: and firſt grow well acquainted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Parties, Diviſions, and little Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in the Town where they live, that ſo they may be perfect at the Trade;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101567:79"/>and fit to ſet up; and Act their parts of the Tragedy their Maſters are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as ſoon as it is ready to appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Publick Theater of the World. In a word, they are intimately acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Jeſuites Maxim, which they uſe againſt the Proteſtants, <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calumniare, aliquid haerebit:</hi> thus Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht by a certain Lady, who was wont to uſe and give this devilliſh Counſel to ſuch as complain'd to her of any affront or injury they knew not well how to revenge; Defame 'em, Defame 'em, ſome Body will believe it: and whoſe Diſciples and Followers they are, and what deſigns they have, we may ſoon know, if we call to mind, that it was the advice of their great Maſters, when they were to draw up a Charge againſt the moſt innocent King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, Let us blacken him, by all means, let us blacken him; which they did to purpoſe, till their Cruelty gave him the Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Robes for Heaven, dy'd in the pure Scarlet of his own Blood. Nor do theſe of the Nurſery ever fail to put the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in practice; and all this they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101567:79"/>think they may do, and that it is good and juſtifiable, being only againſt the Wicked, who are God's (becauſe their) Enemies: And that hereby they may make them appear ſuch; and manifeſt that they only are the Godly and Elect, and all other Reprobates.</p>
               <p>BUT theſe are but ſlender attempts, and only in order to their Grand Deſign of Religiouſly ſubverting both the Church and State: which let them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt never ſo much againſt, and pretend themſelves never ſo innocent of any ſuch Intentions, I ſhall never be able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve but they do deſign. Others may do as they think fit. But if I meet a Man at <hi>Ware</hi> going towards <hi>London,</hi> I ſhall conclude that to be the Place whither he deſigns his Journey, though he tells me he is travelling towards <hi>York:</hi> which if I were not well acquainted with the Roads, I might otherwiſe be apt enough to credit; eſpecially if I tell him he is miſtaken, and muſt turn back again; and I find he intends to deceive me, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me, I am miſtaken, and that he is in the Right way, and his Wits too;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101567:80"/>and knows better than I can direct him, whither he is going; which is the exact humour of all theſe Barge-Saints, who tugg ſo hard at the Oars of Reformation, and conſtantly Row one Way, and look another.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe Controverſies have been ſo learnedly debated; and they have been ſo often baffled in all they could ſay for themſelves, that I know no <hi>Plea</hi> that has been left them, except <hi>Conſcience,</hi> (which they will not part with) though moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their <hi>Actions</hi> Judge if they have any it is an <hi>Evil conſcience,</hi> and of the largeſt ſize in the <hi>World.</hi> Though the plain truth is, the thing which they call <hi>Conſcience,</hi> is commonly known and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of <hi>Wilfulneſs</hi> in <hi>Opinion;</hi> And is juſt like the <hi>Mother Viper,</hi> which when her young Brood are hunted and in <hi>Danger,</hi> opens her <hi>mouth,</hi> and there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures them, and it may be mortally ſtings the purſuers.

               </p>
               <p>But to go on, they will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with <hi>Generals,</hi> but their attempts deſcend to particulars; and therefore, as

It is always ſome conſiderable time before any <hi>Young Diſciple</hi> does abſolutely forſake our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Communion;</hi> nor do they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally feed them with this ſolid food of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> till by their unnatural biting of their <hi>Mother,</hi> they manifeſt that they have <hi>Teeth:</hi> firſt he comes at the latter end of <hi>Prayers,</hi> which by their temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, he now begins to diſlike: after a while, having linger'd about the <hi>Church-yard</hi> for the <hi>Watch</hi>-word, he drops in juſt as he hears the <hi>Pſalm</hi> beginning to be <hi>ſung,</hi> before the <hi>Miniſter</hi> goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Pulpit:</hi> then it may be he will miſs a day or two; and in time, as he grows to a clearer <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that he is to have no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the <hi>Wicked,</hi> and who thoſe are: he totally leaves the <hi>Church;</hi> to which he rarely returns, till he comes upon mens ſhoulders with his Heels for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to his own Funeral; except to hear a Funeral <hi>Sermon</hi> for a deceaſed Friend
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101567:103"/>or <hi>Relation.</hi> Sometimes the temptation of ſaying Twenty pounds, may perſuade him to come once in a Month, but then only to the <hi>Sermon:</hi> which being ended, he tumbles out of the <hi>Doors,</hi> for fear he ſhould be thought one of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> by praying for it; or have any ſhare in the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> which hating in his Life and Actions, he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to enter into his Ears.

               </p>
               <p>Now the advantages they receive by this <hi>Separation</hi> are principally theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, hereby they come to know their <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Numbers;</hi> and this adds not a little to their confidence; and, as they believe, to their preſent <hi>Security</hi> from <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> and future hopes of <hi>Tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> if not <hi>Eſtabliſhment.</hi> And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does but take notice of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent boaſts they make, how <hi>Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> a part of the <hi>Nation</hi> they are, muſt conclude, that the knowledge of their <hi>Number,</hi> is one <hi>great</hi> and <hi>main end</hi> of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101567:104"/>their <hi>Separation:</hi> and that hereby they ſeem ſecretly to threaten their <hi>Superiours,</hi> into a <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of the <hi>execution</hi> of the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> againſt ſo great a <hi>Party;</hi> whilſt they ſliely intimate how unſafe it is to meddle with a <hi>Multitude,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb a <hi>Populace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> hereby they come to know, and be known one to another; which begets as much Love amongſt them as they are capable of, who are all <hi>Slaves</hi> to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngenerous Intereſt.</hi> Nor does this knowledge of one another, a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the affairs of the Trading part of them; of which ſort of people their greateſt numbers conſiſt: and who, it may be, became <hi>Proſelytes</hi> only in hope of the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> of the <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> of which they aſſure themſelves, if they be ready Money-<hi>Cuſtomers,</hi> preſently; and if not ſuch, as ſoon as they can get clear of the <hi>Debt-Book</hi> of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> with whom at preſent they are forced to deal: and though ſome from experience are of another <hi>Opinion,</hi> yet they queſtion not but they ſhall have honeſt dealing and good pennyworths: and poſſibly this ingroſſing and forcing a Trade amongſt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101567:104"/>themſelves, together with their avoiding all troubleſome Offices in the lower Sphere of the State, are not the leaſt <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements</hi> to their <hi>Separation,</hi> nor the ſmalleſt ſteps to thoſe <hi>Riches,</hi> which they ſo much boaſt are amongſt their <hi>Party;</hi> for I remember it was their common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that the great <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Money,</hi> and the ſenſible decay of <hi>Trade</hi> for theſe laſt <hi>Years</hi> before the <hi>Toleration,</hi> was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by their keeping up their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> or not giving down their <hi>Milk,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſeems, in a <hi>ſullen Humour,</hi> becauſe they were kept within the <hi>Paſture,</hi> and not permitted to make all <hi>Common,</hi> or range into the <hi>Corn-Fields.</hi> Though after all theſe brags, I have not met with any perſon, whoſe obſervation has found Money more plentiful, or Trading a Farthing better, even in the time of the <hi>Toleration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But laſtly, By this <hi>Separation</hi> they are ſure to undermine the foundation of all <hi>Government,</hi> which is the principal thing they always aim at, both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> for by their departing from one, and <hi>Diſobedience</hi> to both, they bring their <hi>Power</hi> into <hi>queſtion</hi> and <hi>contempt:</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:101567:105"/>and whileſt they endeavour to render them <hi>odious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tyrannical, heatheniſh</hi> and <hi>perſecuting, ſuperſtitious</hi> and <hi>unlawful,</hi> and yet eſcape unpuniſhed, by the hopes of the like <hi>impunity</hi> they encourage others to follow their example, and inſult over the <hi>Laws;</hi> and to eſteem of all <hi>Power</hi> as the <hi>Frogs</hi> in the <hi>Fable</hi> did of their <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en King.</hi> And this is all in order to the accompliſhment of their <hi>ultimate Deſign;</hi> which is the ſubverſion of the preſent <hi>Government,</hi> both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> in order to the ſetting up a new one according to their own Phancies and Humours.</p>
               <p>Now to demonſtrate the unlawfulneſs of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> it were enough to ſhew, that in <hi>Publick</hi> they will rarely own it themſelves; and will never charge the reaſon of their <hi>Separation</hi> upon any of theſe ends, but upon the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> to which they pretend their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> will not give them leave to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</hi> I think we ſhall cut the <hi>Sinews</hi> of this pretence, and ſhew how feeble and lame an <hi>Excuſe</hi> it is; If we conſider, That theſe <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion are acknowledged to be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101567:105"/>in their own <hi>Natures:</hi> and the reaſon they give why they are <hi>unlawful,</hi> is becauſe they are Impoſed; the <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> being thereby taken away. Now this is a moſt certain truth, that an indifferent thing, when commanded by a <hi>Lawful Authority,</hi> ceaſes to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and becomes neceſſary: for all the Authority of the <hi>Church</hi> to command or impoſe is only exerciſed upon indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things: What is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is commanded by God; whatever is unlawful is forbidden by him; ſo that they muſt of neceſſity either take away all <hi>Liberty</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi> to impoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, that ſo they may have their <hi>Liberty,</hi> (which is unreaſonable to deſire, and if granted them, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that <hi>Liberty</hi> which they would have) or they muſt deny the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Authority</hi> that commands and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines indifferent things; otherwiſe let them confeſs, that they ſeek for a knot in a <hi>Ruſh</hi> to maintain the <hi>Quarrel.</hi> But the plain <hi>Truth</hi> is, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> they have for this <hi>Engine</hi> of <hi>Separation,</hi> is to ſhew by their <hi>Example,</hi> that they believe the <hi>Authority</hi> which commands theſe things,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101567:106"/>is no <hi>Lawful Authority;</hi> that therefore the impoſitions are not neceſſary, or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to them a Duty: for rtherwiſe I cannot think them ſo <hi>ſottiſh</hi> but they know it is; and I am ſatisfied, if they were in <hi>Power,</hi> they would uſe the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to perſuade to <hi>Obedience</hi> which now we do; though they have ſtronger in their Budget upon <hi>occaſion,</hi> than have been yet employed to make them <hi>obey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for a further manifeſtation of this <hi>Error,</hi> we will bring it to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Mat 13.29</note> in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Tares.</hi> The zealous Servants were for a preſent <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>Extirpation</hi> of the <hi>Tares</hi> from among the <hi>Wheat:</hi> But the <hi>Wiſe Maſter</hi> was of another judgment. Not ſo, leſt they ſhould root up the <hi>Wheat</hi> alſo; and certainly as before was ſhewn, this <hi>Separation</hi> of theirs, has not fail'd of that <hi>effect;</hi> but has already rooted up much of the good fruits of <hi>Charity, Peace</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> out of the <hi>Church,</hi> and has left us the <hi>Tares</hi> of <hi>Diſſention</hi> in their room; of which we may well ſay, an <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath done this.</hi> And whether this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> is purſued to the uttermoſt, would not lead them to <hi>Extripation</hi> of the <hi>Tares,</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:101567:106"/>let their <hi>Holy League witneſs.</hi> For they all hold, that <hi>Dominium fundatur in gratiâ,</hi> and the <hi>Wicked</hi> have only a borrowed <hi>Right</hi> to whatever they have of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Fortune.</hi> And how eaſie it is for <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Covetouſneſs</hi> to perſwade them when in Power, to invade the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Sinners,</hi> and ſpoil the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we call to mind former things, which though the <hi>Gracious Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion</hi> has pardon'd them for; they will never pardon the forced <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Kings, Biſhops, Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter-Lands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this being only a <hi>Parable</hi> may not be ſufficiently convictive. Let us look therefore for <hi>Example.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">St. Joh 13.15.</note> Now the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus,</hi> who tells us he was to be our <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> was ſo far from <hi>Separation,</hi> or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>Sinners</hi> a <hi>Crime,</hi> that it was one of the greateſt <hi>Objections</hi> againſt him,<note place="margin">S.

                  <note place="margin">S. Matt. 11 19</note> which accuſation he did not excuſe himſelf of, but juſtifie, from the good deſigns of thereby calling <hi>Sinners to repentance.</hi> Nor do we find, that ever he <hi>ſeparated</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:101567:107"/>Himſelf or his Diſciples from the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> though full of ſuch <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as he came by fulfilling to abrogate: but, as his cuſtom was, he went into the <hi>Synagogue</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath-Days;</hi> went up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to celebrate all the commanded <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> even to the laſt <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> at which he was betray'd. And further to ſhew us, that we ought not to break <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> or <hi>Communion</hi> with thoſe who continue in the <hi>Viſible Church;</hi> he was as converſant with <hi>Judas</hi> as with the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and yet he knew from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who it was that ſhould betray him, knew <hi>Judas</hi> to be a covetous Hypocrite, and worſe than that, a Devil; and it is more than probable, that he himſelf at the firſt <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> gave the <hi>Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> to <hi>Judas,</hi> as will appear to any that reads that place of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Chap. 22. from the thirteenth Verſe to the two and twentieth.</p>
               <p>And for the lawfulneſs of <hi>Separation,</hi> let us hear St. <hi>Jude,</hi> who having given us ſuch a <hi>Character,</hi> as I ſhall hereafter ſhew exactly fits theſe men, leſt their fair pretences ſhould ſtill endanger our
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101567:107"/>miſtake, he concludes it with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive <hi>Note</hi> of <hi>Separation: Theſe are they;</hi> if you know them by nothing elſe you ſhall be ſure to diſcover them by this; <hi>Theſe are they that</hi> Separate <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S.

               <p>Could they prove us guilty of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> or that we erre in any <hi>Subſtantial Fundamental</hi> point of <hi>Religion,</hi> then their <hi>Separation</hi> would not only be <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> but <hi>neceſſary:</hi> but, till they can do this, and convince us that we are not a true <hi>Church,</hi> their <hi>Separation</hi> from us is <hi>unchriſtian,</hi> and <hi>unlawful;</hi> condemned by Chriſt and his holy Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>But all this is nothing: Their <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> muſt be ſuch as well ſerve their <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi> and cannot be <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> unleſs it brings in <hi>Gain;</hi> and ſhould this <hi>Doctrine</hi> once appear unlawful, down goes their <hi>Dagon,</hi> and loſes both his Head and Hands, and will be an uſeleſs <hi>Trunk,</hi> a mere <hi>Stump,</hi> and no longer a <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſetting up the two <hi>Golden Calves</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:101567:108"/>was not the leaſt Policy of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi>

               <p>NOW to the end that they may have the better opportunity to diſperſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101567:109"/>and divulge their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> there is no place that can be ſo ſubſervient as the <hi>Pulpit:</hi> a <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> from thence having gained the mighty <hi>Reputation</hi> of being <hi>Authentique;</hi> and the generally received <hi>Opinion</hi> being, that from that place men ſpeak as the <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> and that every <hi>Word</hi> that comes from their <hi>mouths,</hi> is as true as the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> as in truth it ought to be.</p>
               <p>There is therefore a <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> that they ſhould exalt Preaching, as the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, moſt <hi>excellent Chriſtian Duty;</hi> and give it the preheminence above all other <hi>Ordinances.</hi> And this is the third <hi>Doctrine</hi> which for the ſame <hi>Deſign</hi> with the other, with ſo much vehemence and earneſtneſs they preſs upon the People.</p>
               <p>And to ſatisfie you how ſtrangely the preſent Age is enamoured of the Pulpit, and how great an <hi>Opinion</hi> People have of what is ſpoken there.

Preach in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons; being determined to try if the ſame <hi>Matter</hi> would take better from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> than it had done from the <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Desk,</hi> he choſe ſuch <hi>Texts</hi> as were ſuitable to the <hi>Doctrines</hi> he intended to Expound upon; and from them deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the very ſame <hi>Words</hi> he was reſolved to uſe in his <hi>Expoſition.</hi> Nor did the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at all deceive his expectation: The Church is now throng'd and crowded, whereas before it uſed to look as if the <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Pillars</hi> muſt have ſaid <hi>Amen,</hi> as 'tis ſaid, they once did to the Prayers of our Venerable <hi>Bede:</hi> The <hi>Diſcourſes</hi>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:101567:110"/>by joyning with him in humble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Prayers and Praiſes: But they think they have not their Penniworths for their Penny, and that a man takes no pains for what he does not ſpeak in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> or if he does not Preach twice in a day.</p>
               <p>Beſides, <hi>Curioſity</hi> and the deſire and love of <hi>novelties,</hi> and mighty <hi>Natural:</hi> and the <hi>Athenian</hi> humour does but too univerſally prevail; a certain pleaſure in hearing or telling ſome <hi>New</hi> thing. So that a <hi>Sermon,</hi> though never ſo good and uſeful, which was preached in the <hi>Morning,</hi> would be <hi>Crambe bis costa,</hi> nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous, if repeated in the <hi>Afternoon;</hi> and with this humour of the World theſe men are ſo well acquainted, that it is <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi> that makes the Feaſt, that uſually they have one Text for the <hi>Morning,</hi> and another for the <hi>Evening</hi> Sermon; and neither the ſame Prayer exactly, before or after either: though it is but putting <hi>Almighty</hi> before <hi>Eternal,</hi> or <hi>Eternal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Almighty,</hi> and it will pleaſe. And I am perſwaded, if any man would give himſelf the trouble in Short-hand to write down one of their Prayers, for
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101567:111"/>three or four Days together; he would find the great <hi>Secret</hi> of <hi>Extempore-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to conſiſt in this neat and cunning tranſpoſition, turning the inſide outward, and the foreſide backward; more than in any thing of <hi>New Invention;</hi> at which, for all their pretended <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Parts,</hi> few of theſe <hi>Men</hi> have been obſerved to be very ready or excellent.</p>
               <p>And this is one great <hi>Reaſon</hi> (and the <hi>Reaſon</hi> why they uſe it) why the <hi>People</hi> do ſo much nauſeate the <hi>Publique Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and prefer theſe <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Raptures</hi> before them. Juſt thus did the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> deſpiſe that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Food,</hi> the <hi>Heavenly Manna;</hi> of which 'tis ſaid, that it had <hi>Omnimodum Saporem,</hi> a particular taſte to pleaſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>palate:</hi> and yet thoſe murmuring Tribes were not contented with it; but their <hi>Souls</hi> were dried up,<note place="margin">Num. 11.6</note> becauſe there was nothing for them beſides this <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and they would linger after the <hi>Eleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots,</hi> and the <hi>Quails,</hi> though they came with a <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> and went away with a <hi>Plague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many <hi>Perſons,</hi> I doubt not, reſort to the <hi>Church,</hi> to ſatisfie the itching of their
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:101567:111"/>
                  <hi>Ears,</hi> and to hear what the <hi>Miniſter</hi> can ſay; and if he be an <hi>Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Eloquent Man,</hi> it happens to him as it did to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and he is unto them as a very lovely <hi>Song</hi> of one that hath a pleaſant <hi>Voice,</hi> and can play well on an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> for they love to Hear his <hi>Words,</hi> but they Do them not.</p>
               <p>With this gilded <hi>Fly</hi> it is, that theſe cunning <hi>Anglers</hi> bait the <hi>Hook</hi> with which they firſt tickle, and afterwards take ſo many <hi>Trouts.</hi> Having firſt ſet abroad this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> they do with all vehement earneſtneſs promote it amongſt the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and in ſo doing, kill a great many <hi>Birds</hi> with one <hi>Stone;</hi> for they do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by extreamly pleaſe the <hi>Vulgar</hi> (to whom nothing of <hi>Religious Duties</hi> is ſo pleaſing as <hi>Preaching</hi>) and at the ſame time migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily advance their own <hi>Deſigns.</hi> Hereby alſo they add not a little to their own <hi>Veneration</hi> and <hi>Fame;</hi> and ſomething to that which has ſome <hi>Savour, The dear Benevolences.</hi> And they are always care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to tell them, how willing they are to ſpend and be ſpent for the good of their <hi>Souls;</hi> for their ſakes and the <hi>Goſpels:</hi> and thereby ingratiate themſelves into
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101567:112"/>the <hi>Love,</hi> and inſinuate their <hi>Opinions</hi> into the liking of many, who are won upon by theſe <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> firſt to hear them, after a while to approve of them, and become their followers and <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> which when once they are, they cry up and <hi>Trumpet</hi> out the <hi>Praiſes</hi> of their <hi>Teacher,</hi> for an <hi>able, painful, godly man,</hi> in all Companies and Places where they come, and thus roul the <hi>Snow-ball</hi> as big as they can.</p>
               <p>Now the advantages which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and receive by this, are not a few; for firſt, as before was ſaid, they infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige the <hi>People,</hi> and gain upon their <hi>Love,</hi> pretending to do all this freely, and out of pure <hi>Love</hi> and tenderneſs to their <hi>Souls:</hi> knowing well enough that <hi>Magnes amoris amor,</hi> the great <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>Love;</hi> and therefore they demand nothing, but are contented with what they will freely beſtow upon them for their <hi>pains:</hi> which by this <hi>Wheedle,</hi> comes many times to be more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they could ever have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or than ſome of their Followers can honeſtly or conveniently ſpare: of whom ſome, what with this <hi>Liberality</hi> to their
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101567:112"/>
                  <hi>Teachers,</hi> and what by their frequent <hi>gadding</hi> abroad to hear <hi>Sermons,</hi> and in the mean time neglecting the affairs and concerns of their Families at home, or which is as bad, truſting them wholly to Servants, come to be in a condition fit to be relieved themſelves: and to my particular knowledge, ſome of them are not in a little <hi>Danger</hi> of burthening the <hi>Pariſhes</hi> where they live, by waſting what ſhould be for a future <hi>Proviſion</hi> for their <hi>Families,</hi> in this <hi>Godly way</hi> of <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiping.</hi> and though by this great <hi>Zeal</hi> and travailing about, they may think themſelves, or be flatter'd by their <hi>Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> into an <hi>Opinion,</hi> that they are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yet St. Paul thinks and pronounces them worſe than <hi>Heathens:</hi> for if any man provide not for his own, eſpecially thoſe of his own Family, <hi>he hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel,</hi> And if the <hi>Diſciples</hi> be ſuch, what are the <hi>Doctors?</hi> Sure I am, if this be not the <hi>Effect,</hi> it very well may; and if more <hi>People</hi> be not poſſeſſed with this <hi>rambling</hi> and <hi>vagrant Religion,</hi> it is not for want of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to forſake all and follow <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:101567:113"/>and to go from <hi>City</hi> to <hi>City</hi> to hear the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> in this great <hi>Famine</hi> and ſcarcity that there is of it, as with thoſe abuſed places of <hi>Scripture</hi> they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>People</hi> there is, and ſpur them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this <hi>Wild</hi> and travailing <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Should now a whole Family be all at once poſſeſſed with this humour, and in the heat of <hi>Summer,</hi> in Hay-time and Harveſt for <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſake lock up the doors, or if the Servants were more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of <hi>Heavenly</hi> than of <hi>Earthly</hi> things, leave them open, and jaunt ten or twelve Miles to an <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> and it may betwice or thrice in a <hi>Week</hi> beſides <hi>Sunday;</hi> what muſt become of them? they might like the <hi>Graſhopper</hi> ſing in <hi>Summer,</hi> but like her, they muſt either <hi>die</hi> and <hi>ſtarve,</hi> or <hi>ſteal</hi> in the <hi>Winter,</hi> unleſs the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood were more <hi>Charitable</hi> to them than they are to themſelves: and none of all this is either impoſſible or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. But what a brave time ſhould we have, if a whole <hi>Town</hi> or many <hi>Towns</hi> together ſhould be bitten with this <hi>Gad-Fly?</hi> The old <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> who could not march over the Threſhold, would be bravely nurs't at home: I have
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:101567:113"/>known ſomething like this, and where a poor <hi>Child</hi> has been left at home by the tender <hi>Parents,</hi> for all whole <hi>natural affection,</hi> if ſome of the <hi>Neighbours</hi> had not been more <hi>charitable</hi> and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate <hi>Nurſes,</hi> it might have periſh't; and that it is not generally thus, it is not the fault of theſe <hi>Godly Teachers,</hi> as they call them. And if it does not by this way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the <hi>Poor</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> of which there is ſo general a complaint in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I am ſure their abſenting themſelves from their <hi>Pariſh Churches,</hi> and giving incouragement to thoſe who have no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> to do the ſame, gives <hi>opportunity</hi> to many looſe and idle <hi>People</hi> to creep into <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> where they lurk till the time for removing them is expired, whereas did all people reſort to <hi>Church,</hi> a new Face would ſoon be taken notice of, and care would be taken to remedy the inconvenience.</p>
               <p>A ſecond advantage is, that hereby they do gradually accuſtome the <hi>People</hi> by following their pleaſing <hi>Novelties,</hi> to diſlike, neglect, and contemn the <hi>Church</hi> and her <hi>Miniſters, Prayers</hi> and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which laſt, eſpecially the <hi>Holy
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:101567:114"/>Euchariſt,</hi> I have known them willing to receive at the hands of a meer <hi>Lay-man</hi> (though to ſay Truth, few of their Teachers are any other) rather than they would repair to their <hi>Pariſh-Church,</hi> to receive it of their <hi>lawful Prieſt:</hi> becauſe, there they muſt be obliged to hear the <hi>Antichriſtian. Prayers,</hi> ſuperſtitiouſly or idolatrouſly kneel, and have <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Wicked;</hi> all which are an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto them, and abſolutely <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</hi> And are not theſe bleſſed fruits of theſe mens being <hi>Inſtant</hi> in ſeaſon, and (moſt certainly) out of ſeaſon; with which place they do ſo frequently ſcratch this Itch of the Ears. An Itch the more it is ſcratched the more it may, and the more it pleaſes; eſpecially the courſer the Stuff is, the more delightfully it rubs, and is ſtill deſired: until at laſt the blood and ſmart follows the buſie Fingers and <hi>poyſon'd Nails,</hi> and from their ſcratching us till we bleed again, <hi>Libera nos Domine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third advantage they make of <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> is, that hereby as well as in their <hi>Prayer,</hi> they have many opportunities of diſplaying their own <hi>Excellencies,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:101567:114"/>their great <hi>Abilities, Gifts,</hi> and <hi>Parts:</hi> of which, whatever men of <hi>ſober Judgements</hi> may have, They have no ſmall <hi>Opinion:</hi> as is moſt <hi>evident,</hi> by their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate perſiſting in their own <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Wills,</hi> not only againſt <hi>lawful Authority,</hi> and the <hi>wiſe, ſafe</hi> and <hi>prudent Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of their <hi>Superiors,</hi> but againſt <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which muſt certainly ſpeak them <hi>Wiſe</hi> in their own <hi>Conceit,</hi> though thereby they render themſelves more hopeleſs than <hi>Fools,</hi> if we may take King <hi>Solomons</hi> word. And they are ſo far from condeſcending to men of Low degree, that they will not do it to thoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> who are of the <hi>Higheſt;</hi> and whileſt they thus preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> of <hi>ſtrife</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> if they would impartially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their <hi>Hearts,</hi> they would find a great meaſure of <hi>Pride, Conceit</hi> and <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi> at the bottom of them; for as the abovementioned <hi>Royal Writer</hi> tells us, <hi>Only by pride comes contention:</hi> and it is very evident, that in all their <hi>Preaching</hi> they have a great reſpect to advance their own <hi>Fame, Interest</hi> and <hi>Deſign,</hi> by the Authentick recommendation of their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> from the adored
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:101567:115"/>
                  <hi>Pulpit,</hi> which by ſucceſsful <hi>Experience,</hi> they find, do all thereby receive the moſt conſiderable <hi>Advantage.</hi> And how great an <hi>Eſtimate</hi> they ſet upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is apparent, by their <hi>Intruſion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other mens <hi>Pariſhes;</hi> by which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, they neceſſarily ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more fit and qualified, than thoſe who are by <hi>Law</hi> ſtated in thoſe Places, to do the work of an <hi>Evangeliſt.</hi> One of theſe <hi>Men</hi> being about to ſet up for himſelf in another mans <hi>Pariſh,</hi> was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſeveral Arguments to deſiſt; but more particularly, with that <hi>golden Rule</hi> of <hi>Chriſts, Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri nê feceris;</hi> to do as he would be done by: but either it was to him a leaden Argument, or he had a leaden Head; for he would make no other <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> to it, But that it was fit the <hi>People</hi> ſhould be <hi>inſtructed.</hi> I will not trouble my ſelf to explain that that ſpoke his <hi>Senſe</hi> of himſelf, and of the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the place, becauſe it is eaſie to be read without the help of <hi>Spectacles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will now appear no <hi>Wonder</hi> that they do ſo highly magnifie <hi>Preaching,</hi> and look upon it as the only <hi>Means</hi> of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:101567:115"/>
                  <hi>Grace,</hi> ſo that in all their <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> of it, it paſſes amongſt them, with the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Emphaſis</hi> of <hi>The Means;</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their own Extempore-<hi>Prayer,</hi> which they pretend to be the immediate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the <hi>Spirit</hi> (to which I never heard preaching did pretend yet) is but a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid to wait upon it, and muſt lower the <hi>Top-ſail</hi> to this <hi>All-powerful,</hi> this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Soul-ſaving-Ordinance: Good!</hi> very <hi>Good!</hi> and if the <hi>Spirit</hi> muſt truckle to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Humane Invention</hi> be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before <hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> gueſs of the reſt of them by this. And in truth, to hear them exalt it, as they never fail to do, upon the leaſt hint that offers it ſelf in their way; a man would believe, that they think it more <hi>eſſentially</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to <hi>Salvation,</hi> than <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> or <hi>Charity:</hi> of which laſt, and greateſt of the three, you ſhall rarely hear them <hi>Diſcourſe;</hi> the true reaſon being, becauſe all their <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Actings</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to it, and by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule, their golden Language is no better than ſounding <hi>Braſs</hi> and tinkling <hi>Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,</hi> worth nothing without <hi>Charity:</hi> but the pretended <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, to take men
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:101567:116"/>off from their <hi>Settlement</hi> upon the <hi>Lees</hi> and <hi>Dregs</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Meritoriouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Good Works;</hi> to which they ſay all men are but too na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally prone and inclined: and I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to believe it; and that by the high value they ſet upon <hi>Preaching,</hi> a great many of their Followers think, that to go to hear a <hi>Sermon</hi> is a thing wonderfully <hi>Meritorious;</hi> ſo that it is but changing the <hi>Work</hi> and not the <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of <hi>Merit,</hi> which they bring men to by all their <hi>Pains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now do I know, as well as if I were of the <hi>Secret Cabal,</hi> (and ſo I may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a diſguiſe for any thing they know, purpoſely to diſcover their dangerous <hi>Intrigues</hi>) that this one place will, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, keep this Book from ever being read by any of their <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and will heed no other <hi>Sentence</hi> for its <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Oh 'tis a moſt abominable Book, it is againſt <hi>Preaching!</hi> Oh what ſad times ſhould we have, if every body were of this <hi>Perſuaſion!</hi> It is againſt <hi>The Means!

               <p>St. <hi>Peters Sermon</hi> with which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted three thouſand <hi>Souls,</hi> was not one quarter of an hours <hi>Diſcourſe;</hi> nor attended with the <hi>Prologue</hi> of a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded <hi>Extempore-Prayer:</hi> nor indeed,

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:101567:119"/>have the glory of our <hi>Converſion,</hi> and be thought <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> is juſt as if they ſhould firſt pick, our Pockets, and by giving us Braſs again inſtead of our Gold, perſwade us to believe they are our beſt Friends and Benefactors, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful kind and bountiful to us; which indeed would make Us look like Fools and Children, but would certainly prove thoſe who did it to be Cheats and Knaves.

                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.16.</note> of things made ready to their hand; of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would by no means be guilty: But they are not ſo ſcrupulous in that particular as he was; and for all the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and the <hi>Woe,</hi> will rather act the <hi>Biſhop</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> than go to <hi>Mexico</hi> to preach the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and get one of their own.</p>
               <p>And for that preaching which does not preach theſe things, but a Goſpel of their own, that is it which the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> proteſts againſt; and if they or an Angel from Heaven
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:101567:119"/>preach any other <hi>Goſpel</hi> in whole or in part, than what the <hi>Holy Apoſtles</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let him not only be <hi>ſilenced</hi> but <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</hi> And ſo long as the <hi>Pulpit</hi> is made the <hi>Shop</hi> of <hi>Schiſme</hi> (not to ſay <hi>Hereſie</hi>) in the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Forge</hi> of <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> in the State: ſo long as <hi>Preaching</hi> is exalted above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praiſes,</hi> which are the only <hi>Tribute</hi> we can pay our <hi>Almighty Soveraign,</hi> and ſhall be one part of the happy <hi>Employment</hi> in <hi>Heaven:</hi> ſo long as it ſhall ſtand in <hi>Competition</hi> with the <hi>Sacraments</hi> thoſe holy <hi>Seals,</hi> whereby we are ſealed to the Day of <hi>Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> Not only our <hi>Church</hi> ſayes it, but all the true Saints and Servants of God have ſaid the ſame, and will ſay ſo to the end of the <hi>World,</hi> that not onely twice in one Day, but once in a Mans Life is too much for any man to preach, or any Chriſtian people to hear. And of all theſe miſcarriages in Religious as well as Civil concerns, this their <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is, and has been moſt notoriouſly guilty.</p>
               <p>I would not have them take their Meaſures of us by their own Standard:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:101567:120"/>for though they know not how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>

The time was when they pretended there were great abuſes crept into the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> therefore <hi>away</hi> with it, <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> the <hi>Office</hi> it ſelf as well as the <hi>Offence</hi> (if any were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Loyalty, Honours and Eſtates, Crimes great enough for Pride, Envy and Ambition) our <hi>Church</hi> is for no ſuch unreaſonable Methods; nor becauſe they have, and do greatly abuſe <hi>Preaching,</hi> therefore nothing leſs will ſerve than an utter <hi>Abolition</hi> of the thing. I hope were there nothing elſe, yet common Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will allow any <hi>Government</hi> that <hi>Liberty</hi> which is for its own <hi>Preſervation,</hi> and to endeavour to correct thoſe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which by experience are found ſo dangerous to the Souls, Bodies, and Eſtates of Men, both in their Private and Publique Capacities. It is their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing of <hi>Preaching,</hi> making it the <hi>Golden Calf</hi> of <hi>Beth-el</hi> the Houſe of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting it above all other <hi>means</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> It is their juſtling with it for preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:101567:120"/>and not that only, but the <hi>All</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, according to their Meaſure and Manner there can be no true <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> condemns in them, and with very good Cauſe, for it is a moſt manifeſt falſhood; and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> are ſo far from being againſt <hi>Preaching,</hi> that many of them are very eminent and conſtant <hi>Preachers</hi> themſelves, to the <hi>Confuſion</hi> of this notorious <hi>Slander,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that which, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes of himſelf, comes upon them day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Care of all the <hi>Churches</hi> in the heavy as well as honourable <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the plain truth is, This is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a <hi>Tool,</hi> that if it be taken away they cannot go forward with their <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel;</hi> without this they could not be able to Careſs the <hi>People,</hi> or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to diſperſe their <hi>Opinions,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make any tolerable advance in their <hi>Grand Deſign;</hi> and therefore Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing <hi>Godly Miniſters</hi> (of which <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> they only account themſelves) is one of the moſt horrid <hi>Cruelties</hi> that <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> can invent: though unleſs their

               <p>To conclude, it is not for their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Goſſel,</hi> but for their prating with ſuch malicious <hi>Words</hi> againſt <hi>Kings, Prelates, Magiſtrates, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and all <hi>Government Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> for which the <hi>Laws</hi> as well as out <hi>Church</hi> condemns them, and is againſt their <hi>Preaching.</hi>

               <p>As for that ſtrange <hi>Doctrine</hi> which I have heard ſeveral of them main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That all their Anceſtors, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their own Children, who dye in

But this is a neceſſary <hi>Corollary</hi> to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and of their being the only <hi>Elect;</hi> for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all <hi>Heathens,</hi> but all others who are not of their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> are damned (and that till within this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years none could be) or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their <hi>Doctrine</hi> is falſe, and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> may be had without it; and in the <hi>Communion</hi> of another <hi>Church:</hi> which if they confeſs, all goes to <hi>Ruine,</hi> and the <hi>Opus multorum annorum</hi> will be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces; and would not that be a great <hi>Pity,</hi> that ſo curious a Frame ſhould be ruin'd in a Moment? as for their own Children, if they will damn them, who can help it? it is a ſign they are a kind, good natur'd, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Generation of Men.

               <p>It has been eſteemed a State Maxim, by the wiſeſt Heads; <hi>Malum bene poſitum, non eſt temere Removendum.</hi> What muſt we then think of thoſe Perſons who are for <hi>Innovations</hi> in that <hi>Government,</hi> which with the Wiſdom, Caution, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

               <p>But the <hi>Miracle</hi> of <hi>Wonders</hi> is, that theſe men who diſlike and deſpiſe the preſent <hi>Government,</hi> who tread in the ſame <hi>ſteps,</hi> preach the ſame <hi>Doctrines,</hi> uſe the ſame <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Methods,</hi> make the very ſame <hi>pretences</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> with thoſe deſperate <hi>Rebels</hi> who ſo lately did overturn the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſhould yet be able ſo ſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to employ their <hi>Talent</hi> to put the ſame cheat upon us a <hi>ſecond Time;</hi> and ſo eaſily again deceive <hi>People</hi> into the direct Road of thoſe <hi>Miſeries, Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Confuſions, Ruines, Deſolations,</hi> and almoſt <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> which are ſtill ſo freſh in <hi>Remembrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all this do I know they will look as demurly as if <hi>Butter</hi> would not melt in their <hi>Mouthes,</hi> and yet ſpeak as if they had nothing elſe there:<note place="margin">Pſ. 55.21.</note> their <hi>Words</hi> will be ſofter than <hi>Butter,</hi> ſmoother than <hi>Oyl</hi> in pretending all imaginable <hi>Innocence;</hi> and to ſay truth, even the beſt of them, who it may be do not penetrate into

               </p>
               <p>They are not yet come ſo high as to the removing <hi>Evil Counſellors,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that <hi>Stratagem</hi> is too ſtale, and has been too often made uſe of.

                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:101567:128"/>and by conſequence a new <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> but all their Forces are united, and all their Friends are made, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſet up ſuch a perſon as is a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Man</hi> (as they call them) if they can go no further; that is, ſuch a one as will be ſo favourably inclined to them and their affairs, as to let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: and to confirm the probability of this, I heard it confidently affirmed, that one of the great Leaders of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> at an <hi>Election</hi> not long ſince, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all his Party to give their <hi>Voyces</hi> for a <hi>Gentleman</hi> (who it may be would have deceived their Hopes, if he had carried it) with this all-powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, All you that hope for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your Souls, give your Voices for ſuch a one. So that now it is clear that <hi>Elections of Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> is a neceſſary ingredient, and ſign of their <hi>Election</hi> as <hi>Saints.</hi> For I am ſatified that they do not promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much from this <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is compoſed of ſo many <hi>Worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> eminent for their ſufferings for Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, as well as Prudence and Wiſdom. All that ever they hoped for, or it may

               <p>And I think it will appear but too plainly, if likewiſe it be conſidered,

And whoſoever will not do the Law of thy God and of the King, let Judgement be ſpeedily executed upon him, whether it be to Death, or to Baniſhment, or to Confiſcation of Goods, or to Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment.</hi> And though they may ſay this is only the Command of a <hi>Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror;</hi> let them conſider that <hi>Ezra</hi> is ſo far, from thinking it unſcriptural or unlawful, that he bleſſes the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who had put ſuch a thing into the Kings Heart, as was the only expedient to enable him to rebuild the Houſe of the Lord, and bring it to its former Beauty and Glory.</p>
               <p>As for that fort of Puniſhment which is Capital and Sanguinary, as it does not at all ſuit the temper of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:101567:136"/>ſo they are ſatisfied that it is not the Cuſtome of our Law-givers to write theirs, as 'tis ſaid, the Athenian <hi>Draco</hi> did his <hi>Statutes</hi> in <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>Blood.</hi> Nor ſhall theſe <hi>Men</hi> need to fear reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto <hi>Blood,</hi> unleſs they mean in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful <hi>Inſurrections</hi> of their own rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; Or for intentional or actual Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, Treaſon, or Rebellion, to which they ſeem to be in the ready and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way; and therefore ſince, if they will but take care to avoid the Crimes, they are out of the reach of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: we will purſue this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration no further.</p>

               <p>Let us now ſee how they will deal with a third way of <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> which is <hi>Confiſcation</hi> of <hi>Goods,</hi> which has been the penalty that our Laws have moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally inflicted upon <hi>Diſſenters:</hi> and here it has been the general obſervation, that the ſmaller Fines, as twelve pence a <hi>Sunday,</hi> have been moſt effectual, the proceedings upon the greater and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier Fines being more rarely put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; that being generally a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all men, which makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ruine others in their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> as they believe theſe <hi>heavy Impoſitions</hi> would do.

               <p>If the <hi>Penalty</hi> proceeds upon <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as moſt generally it does, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to render the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Informer</hi> odious, ſo that few people of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:101567:138"/>
                  <hi>credit,</hi> will intermeddle in it; and then either it will not be done at all, or it will be undertook by the meaner ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who inform out of the <hi>Hopes</hi> of their ſhare of the Forfeiture; and if it happens (as too many of them are) that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> is given in by looſe, idle, or ſcandalous poor people, then they are ſafe enough, and proclaim to every body, <hi>You ſee what kind of people theſe are, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Swearers, poor pityful Fellows, that will ſay or ſwear any thing for Money, that are hired againſt us, and are our Accuſers.</hi> And this adds not a little to the <hi>confidence</hi> with which their <hi>Leaders</hi> inſpire them, of having a good <hi>Opinion</hi> of themſelves; or of that which hereby others may come to have of them and their wayes, ſeeing them proſecuted (which they call <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted</hi>) by ſuch a fort of people, as having no <hi>Religion</hi> themſelves, may therefore be thought to hate and perſecute ſuch as have: and this alſo affords them an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, which they are not backward to improve, by inſinuating, that the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> which ſets ſuch <hi>Men</hi> at <hi>Work,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages them in it and rewards them for it, is like them <hi>perſecuting</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi>

               <p>It is well that puniſhment is now a ſign of <hi>Grace,</hi> and the ſuffering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>Penalties</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> is come to be <hi>Perſecution.</hi> It is not yet Thirty Years ſince they, or ſo many of them as are alive, were then of another <hi>Judgement;</hi> and made the moſt illegal and unjuſt ſufferings of others, a certain ſign of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi> and being forſaken of <hi>God.</hi> But theſe <hi>People</hi> have very ill <hi>Memories,</hi> though it is the <hi>Opinion</hi> of ſome, that in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:101567:141"/>regard of one excellent <hi>Faculty</hi> they are <hi>Maſters</hi> of, they had need to have good ones. However this gives us ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to hope, that before that time be run about again, all People may be convinced, that this which they call <hi>Perſecution</hi> may be believed to be <hi>Juſt Puniſhment,</hi> ſince the <hi>Scene</hi> of words may be ſo eaſily ſhifted in half an Age. And if once the Vizzard chance to fall off, the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> come to be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what now looks like a <hi>Lamb,</hi> appears to be a <hi>Leopard:</hi> when the <hi>World</hi> comes to underſtand them aright, they will paſs a true <hi>Judgement</hi> of them and their ruinous <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> and ſay,</p>

               <p>And this is ſo far from impoſſible that it is not improbable; and if no perſon will do it for them, they will certainly do it for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewn what great Artiſts they are in eluding all other Penalties, we ſhould now come to a Conſideration of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101567:142"/>the laſt Particular, which is <hi>Baniſhment;</hi> but in regard that Method has never yet been tryed upon them, nor ſo far as I know, ſo much as been deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, I can ſay little to it, nor can I conjecture what <hi>Startagems</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies</hi> they would find out to evade and avoid it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> The Heads of Separation brought to tryal by the Scripture, proved to be falſe Prophets by their Fruits, by the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, by the Time of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; the Signs given to know them by. Wolves in Sheeps Clothing. Their pretence to be the Miniſters of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. The way they would evade theſe Signs; their Plea of not guilty, becauſe not guilty of all, manifeſted to be vain; and ſuch as, if admitted, will clear all, even <hi>Mahomet,</hi> from the guilt of being falſe Prophet.</head>
               <p>THAT theſe Heads of Faction may ſee that I for my own particular Part have a mind to be ſerious with them, and that I am in ſober earneſt, and ſo far paſt the <hi>Luſoria arma,</hi> that I will cloſe in with them, and come <hi>ad Triarios;</hi> and to ſatisfie all thoſe whoſe ſtrength of Prejudice, or Intereſt, does not render them utterly incapable of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; I do cite them before their own Judges, the Scriptures: let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:101567:148"/>fore impartially examine the Character; and then, in God's Name, <hi>Detur digniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo,</hi> let it be awarded to thoſe who deſerve it moſt.</p>
               <p>THAT there ſhall ariſe falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, falſe Prophets, and falſe Teachers in the Church of God, we can make no doubt; having ſo much, and ſo plain, Scripture for it; ſo many Caveats given us againſt them.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Beware of falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> ſaith our great Lord and Saviour, <hi>which come to you in Sheeps Clothing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves. Take heed that no man deceive you, for many ſhall come in my Name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many.</hi>

                  <hi>Falſe Prophets, and falſe Chriſts ſhall ariſe, ands ſhew Signs and Wonders to ſeduce, if it were poſſible the very Elect; but take ye heed, behold I have foretold you all things.

                  <hi>Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall Men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw Diſciples after them? Therefore watch.</hi> And <hi>S. Peter</hi> is in the ſame mind: <hi>But there were falſe Prophets amongſt the People,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>S. Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>even as there ſhall be falſe Teachers
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:101567:149"/>amongſt you, who primly ſhall bring in</hi> (or as the Word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>NOW as it is moſt certain that there ſhall be ſuch Men, ſo it is no leſs certain, that it ſhall be a very great Difficulty to diſcover and know them.</p>
               <p>FOR, firſt they ſhall come in the Name of Chriſt; pretend a Commiſſion from Chriſt: and as confidently call themſelves the Servants, and Miniſters of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel, as they that really are ſo.</p>
               <p>IN the ſecond place, they ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101567:149"/>to <hi>draw Diſciples after them;</hi> and not a few, but they <hi>ſhall deceive many.</hi> Nay, ſo far able, as if it were poſſible, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the very Elect. And to effect this, it is abſolutely neceſſary, that to deceive the Sheep they ſhould come in Sheeps Clothing, look moſt innocently, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear moſt harmleſs, good and profitable. Nay, further, they muſt have the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and reſemblance of the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs. And this St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us is no difficult thing; <hi>for ſuch,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are falſe Apoſtles, deceitful Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, transforming themſelves into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Chriſt; and no marvel, for Satan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of Light:</hi> therefore it is no great thing, if his Miniſters alſo be transformed as the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>IN the laſt place, <hi>they ſhall ariſe from among our ſelves;</hi> and their deſign ſhall be to draw Diſciples after them.</p>
               <p>THAT we may not be miſtaken, we muſt therefore make a Diſcovery of them, by thoſe Ways, Marks, Signs, and Directions which Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles have in the Scripture given us to diſtinguiſh them and know them by.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:101567:150"/>And therefore, for the fulfilling of any prediction, we muſt firſt enquire for the time of its Appearance; and that is all along ſaid to be in the laſt times or Days. <hi>Now the Spirit ſpeaketh expreſly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.</note> 
                  <hi>that in the latter Times ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall depart from the Faith, giving heed to ſeducing Spirits, and Doctrines of Devils.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>This know that in the laſt days perillous Times ſhall come. In the laſt days ſhall come Scoffers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>S. Pet.</hi> 3.3.</note> 
                  <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their own Luſts or Deſires.</hi> And St. <hi>Jude</hi> tells us who they are,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Jude.</hi> 18.19.</note> 
                  <hi>They who ſeparate themſelves.</hi> So far the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is clear it ſhall be in the laſt Days. The difficulty will be to know when theſe laſt Days are, theſe dangerous Days. St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates plainly when we are to look upon the Time as the laſt Days. And having told us that in the latter time ſome ſhould depart from the Faith, he ſubjoynes, <hi>For the time will come when they will not endure ſound Doctrine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3.</note> 
                  <hi>but after their own Luſts, ſhall heap up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Teachers, having itching Ears.</hi> And thus far the diſcovery is plain, that theſe are thoſe laſt and perillous Times, which he propheſied ſhould come, and with the moſt remarkable Aſterisk points
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:101567:150"/>them out to us. Sure there was never any Age or Time like this for the itching of Peoples Ears, nor for their heaping up to themſelves Teachers after their own Deſires. And to ſatisfie himſelf of this, a man need not take a far Journey or ride a Horſe to Death; for if he cannot find it true in his own Town or Pariſh or even at his own Door, he may walk on foot to the next, where he will certainly find it. And ſo ſtrangly do Peoples Ears itch after Novelties, That let every Day in the Week a Teacher of a new Doctrine come amongſt them, a great Company ſhall run to hear him. Nay, ſhould a man come cloathed with outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sanctimony and Innocence, and with confidence tell them a fine ſtory out of the <hi>Jewiſh Talmud or Turkiſh Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> and pretend it is a new Revelation, I queſtion not but he would have a great many Hearers, and ſome Diſciples. And for their heaping them up to themſelves, is it not as evident as the former? When People are not contented with their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter, (though never ſo Painful, Orthodox and Pious,) who is ſet over them and appointed to watch for their
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:101567:151"/>Souls as he that muſt give an account: but they muſt heap them up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; have them of their own chuſing, according to their own Fancies and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and not one, but many, two, three, four, or more Itinerant and Reſident, in ſome little Towns, and far more in Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of good Capacity; for you muſt know, that as this ſort of People make advances in knowledge and Confidence which they call growing in Grace, they are as they think all taught of God, and are to be Teachers of God. Though that Prophecy, as he himſelf explains it, was meant of Chriſt, the eternal Son of God, and fulfilled in him, and by him who was God, and therefore thought it no Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God; though it is a manifeſt and the higheſt piece of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in any Mortal Man to arrogate it to himſelf.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Joh.</hi> 6.45. <hi>S. Joh.</hi> 14.6.</note> And ſays he, <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God. Every Man therefore that hath heard, and hath learn't of the Father, cometh unto me, for no man can come unto the Father, except I draw him.</hi> But this will not ſatisfie them; for to gain the greater Authority and reputation they will apply it to themſelves; ſo that in ſome places
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:101567:151"/>where the infection has ſpread it ſelf ſtrongly, every third or fourth Houſe can afford you one or more if occaſion be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man or Woman Teacher, though S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives an expreſs Command againſt theſe Female Doctreſſes,<note place="margin">8. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12.</note> and tells us po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively a Woman is not to be permitted to ſpeak in the Church, that is, to teach. For which Command I met with one of the moſt ſubtile allegorical fine-ſpun E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions, as far exceeding the Brains of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen:</hi> The Woman (ſaith a Diſſenter) muſt learn in ſilence, that is the Fleſh; for all Fleſh muſt be ſilent before the Lord, Very well, repl'd I! and nicely diſtinguiſh't, to make us all Hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites; but how will the Woman part of you by this ſobriety come to be ſaved in Child-bearing? which the Apoſtle adds as a good encouragement to them to keep them in ſilence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 15</note> which you know is a hard matter, and that they may not uſurp Authority over the Man: and here the Man and Woman were both ſilent, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of the old Fig leaves to make an Apron of or Apron-ſtrings for an Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by which he might have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't, that his Fleſh was no Woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:101567:152"/>HAVING proceeded thus far; and found out the Time of their Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it follows that we examine theſe Teachers: and as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, Let them pretend never ſo much to the Spirit, <hi>Try the Spirits whether they are of God: becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR moſt bleſſed Lord has given us a Criterion, an infallible Touch-ſtone, to diſtinguiſh Gold from Braſs though double gilt; a certain way to know the Wolf though in Sheeps Clothing, from the good Shepherd:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>By their Fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> Not by their ſeeming good Fruits, their appearance of Holineſs, and profeſſion of Godlineſs: for in theſe things they transform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the likeneſs of the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, or otherwiſe they could never be able to deceive. It is not by their zealous and paſſionate<note n="‖" place="margin">

                  <hi>Lord! Lord! for not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> It is not by their<note n="*" place="margin">The word Prophecy is uſed for Preaching, and by them ſo underſtood in many places; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe ſo often to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance their way, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not Prophecying.</note> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying in his Name, their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and painful Preaching of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:101567:152"/>Chriſt, of Strife and Envy. No, nor by their wonderful and miraculous Works done (as they ſay) in his Name. Their converting ſo many poor Souls from Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, Heatheniſm, and Idolatry, who were better Chriſtians before. For, Chriſt tells us, for all this, be will not know them for his. <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that Day, Lord, Lord, have we not Propheſied (or Preached) in thy name, and tit thy name caſt out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful Works? And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you; Depart from me yon that work Iniquity.</hi> By their ill Fruits therefore it is, by their working Iniquity that we muſt diſtinguiſh them; and without a careful obſervation of this, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know them from the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Preachers and Miniſters of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>NOW whether the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and her Prophets, or theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, are the falſe, let their Fruits deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine? Certainly they who both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Diſcipline, not only Teach but practice, in their Lives, Actions and Intentions, a true departing from all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:101567:153"/>quity; from whatſoever is contrary to the Commands of the Goſpel: Theſe are the true Prophets, the Servants and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt, who by theſe good Fruits may be known by us to be ſuch as ſhall by him be known and owned for his at that Day. And they who under pretences of Piety and the Cloak of Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs Preach themſelves and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their Party, who by their .Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Example teach others, to live in Envyings, Hatred, Strife, Sedition, Diſobedience, and (in the moſt modeſt Expreſſion of it) Principles of Rebellion; all which are directly contrary to the Commands of Chriſt, and the Goſpel, which are works of Iniquity; I they who do ſuch things are workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and falſe Prophets; who though they may come in Sheeps Clothing, yet inwardly they are Ravening Wolves. And that the Doctrines and Deſigns, the Principles and the Practice of theſe Diſſenting Factious Heads of Parties, do all terminate in theſe as in their Center and ultimate End, (however they may be wide enough diſtant in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of ſeveral of their Doctrines one
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:101567:153"/>from the other) has already in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Pages been ſhewn; and by their former actions, it has more at large, and beyond the Effrontery of Impudence it ſelf moſt demonſtratively been manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and with the Pen of Iron, and Point of their poyſonous, though glittering, Diamond, been ingraven in ſuch deep and bloody Characters, as whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes would not contain: and I heartily wiſh they would give us leave with the general and moſt gracious Amneſty to forgive and forget; and not by their reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and repeated Machinations, give our Fear, thoſe alarming Paſſions of Mens Souls, a juſt occaſion to call them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and by comparing paſt Events with preſent Circumſtances, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that they are brewing a ſecond draught in <hi>Circes</hi> Golden Cup, to intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icate the People, and transform them again into Wild and Savage Beaſts of Prey, to worry the Government; and by the moſt real Lycanthropy to feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on humane Fleſh.</p>
               <p>If they ſhall, (as I do not queſtion but for an Evaſion they will) indeavour to hide the Teeth and Paws of the Wolf,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:101567:154"/>by the ſoft and woolly Words and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations; that they are far from the thoughts and intentions, of thoſe Men of the late times: How can we be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of it? Thoſe very Men ſaid the ſame, and it may be at firſt had not thoſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themſelves, which following ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes inſpired them with, and as they thought, warranted them in, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Confident Motto of their Coin, (of which, for all that) abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance was, like themſelves, Counterfeit; only Braſs plated over, which was, God with us, The Commonwealth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and if a Man may, in ſo ſerious an affair be permitted to be pleaſant, it might be taken notice that God and they were not both of a Side; however they made this ill Conſequence upon their falſe Suppoſition, <hi>If God be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi> Why do theſe Men write ſo exactly after ſo foul a Copy? Why do they in all things come to ſo near a Reſemblance of thoſe Men, (whoſe words though at firſt moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, yet ended in Actions odious, as well as unexampled to the World) ſo that an Egg is not liker an Egg than the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:101567:154"/>one is to the other? The ſame Way, if purſued, muſt lead to the ſame End: and till by their Juggling they are able to caſt ſuch a Miſt hot only before my Eyes, but my Underſtanding and Memory, as to perſwade me that this is not Black and White which all the World calls ſo; I ſhall never be brought to believe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that they are the Children of thoſe (or the Men themſelves) that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Prophets, by the great Zeal they have to build them Monuments; that is, to bury the preſent Church and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Grave of oblivion. And by their ſo often telling us that the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is a dead Letter, they plainly give us to underſtand that it is very offenſive to their Noſes and Eyes, and more than time it were (in its own Linen, the Surplice) buried out of their ſight: and I dare ſay, they are as generous as that <hi>French</hi> King, who being perſwaded to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deface the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre of a great <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain, who lay interred moſt magnificently at <hi>Roan;</hi> he reply'd, I wiſh all my Enemies were as honourably buried. And I hope all ſober and conſiderative Perſons will be of the ſame Judgment with me: I an ſure they
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:101567:155"/>muſt, if they love themſelves, their King, Church, of Country, againſt which theſe men are (ſome of them actually, by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant, and Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſworn Enemies, though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it never ſo often, and pretend never ſo much Innocence, Sincerity, and godly Simplicity of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>BUT ſince there is a neceſſity of a full and clear Conviction, we will bring in more evidence againſt them; and no worſe Men than the Holy Apoſtles: and if ſuch a Jury as Chriſt and his twelve Apoſtles find it <hi>Billa vera,</hi> and that they are guilty of what they ſtand indicted for, let them acquit and abſolve them that can; I am ſure they have no hope but by confeſſion and amendment to crave the Pſalm of Mercy.</p>
               <p>BUT before we come to theſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainders it will be requiſite that we ſtop up one avenue, at which otherwiſe they will undoubtedly all creep out, and eſcape the Judgment of Men, though never the Righteous Judgment of God, who knows all things, and does not judge according to outward appearance, but as things or perſon are in themſelves. If you bring
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:101567:155"/>them to any of the Places I ſhall hereafter mention; becauſe every thing in them does not exactly hit them, they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all the World and themſelves too I am afraid, that they are not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in thoſe Deſcriptions of Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and falſe Teachers. Thus though in their Principles they may be Traitors, and in their Practice Heady, High-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet if they do not forbid to Marry, or to abſtain from Meats; that Place is meant of the Papiſts who do ſo; or it may be they will ſay of they Church of <hi>England,</hi> which commands abſtinence in the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> and upon other Faſts: though that is a Civil as well as a Religious Sanction, as will appear by the Statutes which do injoyn it, 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

As for the Command of our Church, it is wholly Religious; Nor does the Church think thoſe Meats unlawful at other Times; and only enjoyns abſtinence, that our Fleſh being ſubdued tot the Spirit, we may the better be enabled to obey the Godly Motions of Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs; as the Collect for the firſt Sunday in Lent teaches us to Pray: which therefore all they who quarrel at, or will not pray for, muſt declare themſelves Enemies to; and that they are againſt thoſe Means, which the Church of God has ever in and ſince the Primitive Times thought ſo conducive to thoſe great ends of Religion.</p>
               <p>NOW to ſhew the invalidity of this Plea, we muſt conſider. That the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtles was to mark out all falſe Prophets of what Perſwaſion, Name or Diſtinction ſoever. And If none are
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:101567:156"/>falſe Teachers or Prophets, but ſuch to whom every thing they mention does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; then would the Character of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and thoſe Marks of Diſtinction which they give us to know them by, be altogether in ſignificant, impracticable and uſeleſs: for it is impoſſible to find all thoſe Deviliſh Qualifications, combined in one Perſon or Sect; no not in <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> himſelf, who certainly was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Impoſtor (and it may be <hi>The Falſe Prophet</hi>) that ever was, or will be in the World. And therefore theſe ſigns are promiſcuouſly laid down, hut are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to be applied, ſome of them to one ſort or Sect, and ſome to another, as they will ſuit and agree to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Actions: and he is as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Falſe Teacher, (though not ſo great a one) who is wilfully guilty of one or more of theſe ſigns by which we muſt diſcover the falſe Prophets from the True, as he would be who could really be charged with them all. And if theſe Men do not grant the Truth of this Preliminary Aſſertion, it muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they dare not joyn Iſſue with us in the Tryal: but being ſatisfied before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand

               <p>BUT further; Are they not heady as well as high-minded, wilfully wedded to their own wayes, and in effect lovers of Pleaſures, of their own Pleaſure more than lovers of God, or of his Pleaſure?

               <p>IS not all this manifeſt from their Daily Practice? and which they juſtifie, telling us there is a neceſſity laid upon them from their Conſciences ſo to do. And which rather than they will not effect, and left it ſhould not be as clear as the Sun who they are that the Apoſtle points out unto us in this Deſcription: Are they not of this ſort <hi>who creep into Houſes, and lead Captive ſilly Women laden with Sins, led away with divers Luſts,</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of deſires, or deſire of varieties and Novelties? I am fore this part of the Character hits them like the left-handed <hi>Benjamites,</hi> to a hairs breadth; and needs no Comment, or Marginal Notes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the meaning.</p>

               <p>NOR will they find much more favour at the Hands of St. <hi>Peter</hi> than of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> Where, after he had been ſpeaking of the falſe Prophets which had been, and ſhould come, all which I will not accuſe them of, there being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of what is obvious to all Men, Eſpecially, or chiefly, ſays he, <hi>Such are they who walk after the Fleſh;</hi> that is, in oppoſition to the Spirit; after the Works of the Fleſh, and not after the Fruits of the Spirit, as before has been often ſhewn: Such as walk <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>AND however the Men of this Party made the great and learned Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> ſo much a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as for that ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion or imputation to loſe his Head; they are obliged to that Head which we loſt more than He: And the beſt Arms they can employ againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they muſt be forc'd to borrow out of his Magazine: and ſo long as that Incomparable Piece of his againſt <hi>Fiſher</hi> continues in the World; it will be an Eternal Monument of his Learning, Piety and firmneſs in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine; and of their falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Cruelty in depriving our Church and the whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> cauſe, of ſuch an able Chief and expert Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and for no other Crimes but his Loyalty to his Prince, his Conſtancy to
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:101567:164"/>the Church, and his wearing the Sacred and Venerable Miter. Crimes great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if They were Judges, to take off the Heads of all the Biſhops in the World.</p>
               <p>THEY cannot but know how many ſeveral times before a Man comes from a Colledge to a Cathedral he muſt take the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> THE CONCL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SION.</head>
               <p>AND now having found them thus guilty, I know they will ſay, I am a Man of a perſecuting Spirit, a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, a <hi>Machiavellian;</hi> a hard word they uſe to brand their Enemies withall, and which moſt of their Party know not what it means, whether a man or a Devil, or ſomething worſe if it could be. But it has been the hard meaſure of thoſe whoſe names I do ſo reverence, that it will be the greateſt honour they can do me to put me in the Rear of them. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation was ſaid to be a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan,</hi> and to have a Devil; and the great Apoſtle tells us he was by ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted their Enemy becauſe he told them the Truth; and ſo long as the World indures it will be ſo: For,</p>
               <q>Obſequium Amicos, Veritas odium parit.</q>
               <p>Flattery will for a while procure many Friends, but great is the Truth, and will
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:101567:165"/>prevail though it raiſes a Man never ſo many Enemies. And if it ſhall be ſaid, All Truths are not fit for all times, I muſt make that Neceſſity plead for me which can do violence to Nature; and which made the Son of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> who before was Dumb, break his Silence with <hi>Regem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite occidere.</hi> And it would make the dumb Aſs ſpeak the ſecond time, if ſhe were alive, to reprove the madneſs of theſe Prophets who run on in the Wayes of <hi>Balaam,</hi> to curſe a Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom the Lord hath Bleſſed; and they ſhall be bleſſed, when theſe their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall inherit the Woe, and periſh in the Gainſaying of <hi>Corah.</hi> The very Geeſe will awaken the Gauls when they hear the Barbarous <hi>Gauls</hi> ſecretly creeping up the Hill, to ſurprize the Capitol. And the ſilly Curs will bark, when they hear the Evening Wolf coming towards the Fold, to worry the Sheep. Danger opens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Eye, and Fear will open any Mouth.</p>
               <p>I do not queſtion but to run through various Cenſures: and am ever ſince I was at School, acquainted with the Fate of Books.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:101567:165"/>Pro captu Lectoris, habent ſua fata Libelli.</q>
               <p>And though it is uncommon, yet give me leave to cloſe this Diſcourſe, with what is uſually the begining of others, ſomething to the Reader; which I do not becauſe I love innovations, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I hate long Prefaces, and will not be a Pimp to my own Pen, or Court the coy to caſt their Eyes upon the following Sheets, with Epiſtolary Rhetorick: I had rather have People read, if they think good, and then judge, than judge by the Elaborate Front, and after read what it may be they will not like; and meet with Eger Wine after all the Promiſes of the Carved and Gilded Buſh. All I have to ſay for my ſelf is, That if I have not done ſo well as I ſhould, I have done as well as I could: and am ſure I ſhall deceive no expectation, becauſe nothing was ever expected from me.</p>
               <p>IF the judicious ſhall tax me of two much Levity, there is to entertain the greateſt Sobriety, even under thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lightneſſes ſerious truths; and it was the humour of the Age, which has vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:101567:166"/>my Inclinations; with which even Truth is hardly palatable, without the <hi>Ragouſt</hi> of <hi>Droll</hi> and <hi>Burleſque.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS for the Aiery and pleaſant, they will think it too ſerious; and ſo it is to play withall: and if it may not, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, advantage them; I ſhall not be offended if they chuſe what they like better.</p>
               <p>AS for my Friends, in which Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I reckon all thoſe that love their Country, Prince, Laws, Liberty, and Religion; they will certainly pardon the Defective Effects of that Zeal and Paſſion I have for them, and their Intereſts; though in ſome things to the ſeverity of Criticks, eſpecially the prejudiced, I may appear to have been ſo far tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported as to ſeem blind.</p>
               <p>AND for my Enemies; to ſhew them I am a Church of <hi>England</hi> Man, I will forgive them, and pray for them; though for ſpeaking out too plain, they hate me, perſecute my Fame, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightfully uſe my Reputation; and it may be I am too intent upon Affairs of greater concern, than to turn again and pelt Stones at the Dogs that bark at me;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:101567:166"/>or to be angry, becauſe I am daſht and beſpatter'd in dirty Ways; which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever travels in the ſame Road of Truth, that I have, muſt of neceſſity expect: and though a great Man tells us, <hi>Of Writing Books there is no End;</hi> I will hope there will be ſuch an End, as proceeds from there being no neceſſity of ſuch Books; becauſe, no occaſion for them.</p>
